## PITCH 1

### *The Saffron Ledger*

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Literary Thriller

**Logline:** When a widowed spice merchant in 1540s Calicut discovers her late husband's secret debts to the Portuguese, she must outwit colonial agents or lose everything her family built over three generations.

**Elevator Pitch:**
Devaki Panikkar has spent her adult life learning what no woman in her family was supposed to learn: the spice trade. When her husband drowns under suspicious circumstances off the Malabar Coast in 1543, she inherits not only his thriving pepper and cardamom business but also a ledger revealing catastrophic debts owed to the Portuguese Estado da India. With the Portuguese tightening their stranglehold on Indian Ocean trade routes, Devaki must navigate a web of colonial administrators, rival Arab merchants, and her own traditionalist in-laws — all while uncovering whether her husband's death was truly an accident. The novel unfolds across the markets, warehouses, and monsoon-drenched backwaters of Kerala, capturing a world where the global spice trade was reshaping civilizations. It is a story about a woman who must become fluent in the language of power — ledgers, contracts, alliances — to survive in a world that was never designed for her voice.

**Time Period:** 1543–1547

**Setting:** Calicut (Kozhikode) and Cochin (Kochi) on the Malabar Coast of India; Portuguese trading posts; the backwater canal networks of Kerala; brief sections aboard trading vessels in the Arabian Sea.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Devaki Panikkar
- **Age:** 34
- **Role:** Widow and reluctant inheritor of a prominent spice trading house
- **Wants:** To secure her two children's futures and preserve her family's independence from Portuguese control
- **Strengths:** Mathematical brilliance, deep knowledge of spice grading and seasonal markets, fluency in Malayalam, Portuguese, and trade Arabic, quiet charisma that earns loyalty from dockworkers and warehouse managers
- **Flaws:** Refuses to ask for help until situations become dire; carries deep shame about her family's lower-caste origins that her husband's wealth had papered over; tendency toward ruthlessness when cornered that alienates potential allies

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** Capitão Tomé de Sousa Coutinho, the newly appointed Portuguese factor in Cochin
- **Nature:** A pragmatic colonial administrator, not a cartoon villain — he genuinely believes Portuguese control brings order to what he sees as a chaotic trade network; he is also under enormous pressure from Lisbon to increase revenue
- **Motivation:** Needs to consolidate Portuguese monopoly over pepper exports; Devaki's independent operation is both a financial nuisance and a symbolic challenge to Portuguese authority; personally, he is desperate to return to Lisbon with enough wealth to restore his disgraced family name

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Devaki must pay off her husband's debts to the Portuguese while simultaneously keeping her trading house independent — an almost impossible balancing act as the Portuguese tighten their cartaz (trade license) system across the Malabar Coast
- **Internal:** Devaki has always defined herself through her husband's identity and social standing; his death forces her to confront who she actually is — a lower-caste woman whose intelligence was always the real engine of the family's success, but whose identity she has spent years suppressing
- **Intersection:** Each time Devaki makes a bold move in the external trade war, she must shed another layer of the deferential persona she constructed to survive in a hierarchical society. Her internal liberation and her commercial survival become the same struggle.

**Themes:**
1. **The personal cost of economic colonialism** — How the Portuguese cartaz system didn't just reshape trade routes but invaded the intimate spaces of families, marriages, and self-identity
2. **Knowledge as power and prison** — Devaki's expertise makes her indispensable but also makes her a target; knowing too much is as dangerous as knowing too little
3. **The invention of widowhood** — How a woman's identity, legally and socially erased by her husband's death, can become the foundation for a radical new selfhood
4. **The globalization of greed** — How the 16th-century spice trade created the template for every extractive economic system that followed

**Series Potential:** Standalone with sequel potential. A second book could follow Devaki's daughter navigating the spice trade a generation later as Dutch competition arrives, and a third could bring the story to the 1600s as the British East India Company enters the picture. The connecting thread would be the trading house itself and the women who run it across three generations of colonial powers.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *The Henna Artist* by Alka Joshi (Indian setting, female protagonist navigating patriarchal structures)
- *The Island of Sea Women* by Lisa See (female-centered historical fiction in a non-Western setting, economic survival)
- *Shōgun* by James Clavell (cross-cultural encounter at the nexus of trade and empire, though told from the colonized perspective here)

**Unique Selling Point:**
The Malabar Coast spice trade is one of the most consequential economic stories in human history — it literally launched the Age of Exploration — yet it remains almost entirely unrepresented in English-language fiction from the Indian perspective. Readers who loved *Shōgun* and its immersive non-Western world-building will find a similarly rich setting here, but centered on an Indian woman rather than a European outsider. The novel's thriller elements — debts, betrayals, a possible murder — give it commercial momentum, while its thematic depth makes it a strong candidate for literary recognition.

**Research Feasibility:** HIGH. The Portuguese presence on the Malabar Coast is exceptionally well-documented through Portuguese administrative records, Jesuit letters, and accounts by travelers like Duarte Barbosa and Tomé Pires. Kerala's own historical traditions (Keralolpatti, granthavari records) provide rich local detail. The spice trade itself has been the subject of extensive modern scholarship (Charles Corn's *The Scents of Eden*, Jack Turner's *Spice*, Sanjay Subrahmanyam's *The Career and Legend of Vasco da Gama*). Daily life details — food, textiles, architecture, boat construction, market practices — are available through both historical records and the well-preserved living traditions of Kerala.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 95,000–110,000
- **Chapters:** 28–32
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Devaki); 2 secondary POVs used sparingly (Coutinho; Devaki's eldest son, Unni, age 14)

## PITCH 2

### *The Cartographer's Confession*

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Literary Mystery

**Logline:** A disgraced mapmaker in 1150s Sicily must forge a diplomatic masterwork for the Norman king while hiding a secret that could unravel the fragile peace between the island's Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.

**Elevator Pitch:**
In the court of Roger II, Norman King of Sicily, the island exists as an improbable experiment: a kingdom where Greek, Arab, Latin, and Jewish traditions coexist, producing some of the medieval world's greatest art and science. Yusuf al-Taqi, a Muslim cartographer trained in Córdoba, has been recruited to assist the legendary geographer al-Idrisi in creating the *Tabula Rogeriana* — the most ambitious map of the known world ever attempted. But Yusuf carries a dangerous secret: he was expelled from Córdoba not for the scholarly dispute he claims, but for forging documents that contributed to a man's execution. As the massive mapping project forces Yusuf to collaborate with scholars of every faith, his fraud threatens to surface — and with it, the possibility that critical sections of the great map are based on fabricated sources. Set against the shimmering mosaics, citrus groves, and crowded souks of Palermo, the novel explores what happens when a lie becomes embedded in the architecture of knowledge itself.

**Time Period:** 1150–1154

**Setting:** Palermo and Cefalù in Norman Sicily; flashbacks to Córdoba, al-Andalus. Primary locations include the royal palace complex (with its Arab-Norman architecture), the workshops where the *Tabula Rogeriana* is being assembled, the streets of Palermo's overlapping ethnic quarters, and the cathedral of Cefalù.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Yusuf ibn Ahmad al-Taqi
- **Age:** 29
- **Role:** Journeyman cartographer and geographic compiler, assistant to al-Idrisi
- **Wants:** Redemption through legitimate work — to contribute something true and lasting after the catastrophe of his forgery; also, pragmatically, to rebuild a career and reputation
- **Strengths:** Exceptional draftsman, genuinely gifted at synthesizing geographic accounts from multiple languages and traditions, deeply curious about the world, likable and quick to form bonds across cultural lines
- **Flaws:** Chronic liar who has constructed so many false versions of his past that he sometimes loses track of the truth; a coward when confronted directly; addicted to the approval of powerful men, which is what led him to forge documents in the first place

**Antagonist:**
- **Who/What:** The antagonist is composite — partly Giorgios Doukanos, a Greek-Norman court official who suspects Yusuf's credentials are fraudulent and wants to discredit the mapping project to advance a political agenda; partly Yusuf's own past, which arrives in Palermo in the form of a Córdoban merchant who recognizes him
- **Nature:** Giorgios is not evil but is a political operator who sees the multicultural mapping project as a threat to Latin Christian dominance in Roger's court; the Córdoban merchant, Rashid, is a grieving man whose brother was the one executed because of Yusuf's forgery
- **Motivation:** Giorgios wants political power. Rashid wants justice, or perhaps revenge. Both are understandable.

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Yusuf must complete his sections of the *Tabula Rogeriana* before the king's deadline while preventing either Giorgios or Rashid from exposing his past, which would destroy not only him but the entire mapping project and potentially the fragile interfaith collaboration it represents
- **Internal:** Yusuf must decide whether he is fundamentally a forger or a scholar — whether the skills he used to deceive can be redirected toward creating something true, or whether the lie is so embedded in who he is that everything he touches is contaminated
- **Intersection:** The map itself becomes the metaphor — it is supposed to represent the world as it truly is, but Yusuf's contributions are built on a foundation of fraud. His internal struggle over truth and fabrication plays out literally in the cartographic work.

**Themes:**
1. **The architecture of lies** — How a single fabrication can become load-bearing in the structure of knowledge, impossible to remove without bringing everything down
2. **Convivencia and its limits** — The beautiful, fragile, and ultimately temporary experiment of interfaith coexistence in Norman Sicily, and what pressures cause it to crack
3. **The map is not the territory** — How the act of mapping the world is always an act of interpretation, selection, and quiet distortion

**Series Potential:** Strong standalone. However, the *Tabula Rogeriana* itself could anchor a loosely connected series — a second book following the map's journey after Roger II's death as Sicily descends into chaos, a third following a copy of the map to the Almohad court in Marrakech.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *The Map of Knowledge* by Violet Moller (nonfiction, but covers the same intellectual world — readers of that book are the audience for this novel)
- *The Name of the Rose* by Umberto Eco (medieval intellectual mystery, monastic/scholarly setting)
- *The Liar's Dictionary* by Eley Williams (literary fiction about fabrication embedded in reference works)

**Unique Selling Point:**
Norman Sicily is one of the most fascinating and underrepresented settings in historical fiction — a kingdom where Arab, Greek, Latin, and Jewish cultures produced extraordinary art and science, yet it appears in almost no novels in English. The *Tabula Rogeriana* is a real and astonishing historical artifact (a massive silver planisphere and accompanying geographic text) that provides a natural narrative engine. The novel's central question — what happens when a lie becomes embedded in a work of knowledge — resonates powerfully in an era of misinformation and AI-generated content, giving the book contemporary relevance without anachronism.

**Research Feasibility:** HIGH. Norman Sicily is well-documented through Latin, Arabic, and Greek sources. Al-Idrisi and the *Tabula Rogeriana* are extensively studied (see Jeremy Johns, Ahmad Ferrara, S.P. Scott's translation of al-Idrisi). The architecture of Norman Palermo — the Cappella Palatina, the Palazzo dei Normanni, the Cuba — survives and is well-photographed. Medieval cartographic practices are thoroughly documented. The multicultural daily life of Palermo has been reconstructed by historians like Alex Ferrara and Hubert Houben.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 85,000–100,000
- **Chapters:** 24–28
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Yusuf); 1 secondary used for 4–5 chapters (Giorgios, whose political POV provides context Yusuf cannot access)

## PITCH 3

### *The Feast of Ashes*
#### Book One of *The Burning Glass* trilogy

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Epic Literary with Thriller Elements

**Logline:** A Jewish glassblower's apprentice in 1490s Venice discovers that the furnace he tends is being used to secretly manufacture lenses for a weapon that could change the balance of power in the Mediterranean.

**Elevator Pitch:**
On the island of Murano in 1494, seventeen-year-old Enzo Sforno is one of the few Jews permitted to work in the legendary glassmaking furnaces, thanks to his dead father's extraordinary reputation as a lens grinder. When Enzo discovers that his master, the renowned *maestro* Vittorio Bardolino, is secretly producing optical components that don't match any known instrument, he stumbles into a conspiracy that connects Venetian naval intelligence, Ottoman spies, and a renegade Franciscan friar who believes he can build a device to focus sunlight into a weapon of war. As the Italian Wars erupt and Venice's position in the Mediterranean becomes precarious, Enzo must choose between the safety of silence and the moral imperative to act — all while navigating the brutal social hierarchies that make his Jewish identity both an asset (his father's lens-grinding techniques are irreplaceable) and a liability (he can be expelled from Murano, and from Venice itself, at any moment). The novel immerses readers in the fire-lit workshops of Murano, the canals and campi of Venice, and the tense, glittering world of Renaissance statecraft.

**Time Period:** 1494–1497 (Book One); trilogy would span 1494–1510

**Setting:** The island of Murano (glassmaking furnaces, workers' housing, canals); Venice proper (the Ghetto Nuovo area before the formal ghetto's 1516 establishment, the Rialto, the Arsenal, the Doge's Palace); brief sections in Padua and aboard Venetian galleys.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Enzo Sforno
- **Age:** 17 at opening
- **Role:** Apprentice lens grinder in a Murano glassmaking workshop
- **Wants:** To earn his *maestro* credentials and achieve the security and respect his father never fully attained; deeper down, to understand why his father died in a furnace explosion that may not have been accidental
- **Strengths:** Exceptional manual precision and patience (essential for lens grinding), visual acuity that borders on uncanny, loyalty to the handful of people he trusts, a self-taught understanding of optics that exceeds his formal education
- **Flaws:** Naive about politics and power; tends to see the world in binary moral terms (a dangerous trait in Renaissance Venice); suppresses his anger about anti-Jewish prejudice until it erupts destructively; his obsession with his father's death makes him reckless

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** Vittorio Bardolino, Enzo's master — a brilliant glassmaker who has been seduced by the promise of power and patronage into manufacturing components for a secret weapon project
- **Nature:** Not malicious but deeply compromised; Bardolino genuinely loves the craft and has been a fair master to Enzo, which makes his betrayal complex and painful
- **Motivation:** Bardolino's workshop is failing financially; the secret commission is the only thing keeping it alive. He has also been promised a seat on the Council of Ten's advisory body — an unprecedented honor for a craftsman. He has convinced himself that the weapon will never actually work, so the moral question is theoretical.

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Enzo must determine what the secret optical components are for, who commissioned them, and whether the weapon they enable is real — all while the Italian Wars destabilize Venice's political position and make everyone in the city paranoid about spies and traitors
- **Internal:** Enzo must reconcile his love of the craft and his loyalty to Bardolino with his growing understanding that the knowledge his father passed down — the lens-grinding techniques that make him valuable — may be the very thing that caused his father's death
- **Intersection:** The optical weapon literalizes the novel's central metaphor: the same glass that brings clarity (lenses, vision) can also be turned into a destructive instrument. Enzo's journey from naive apprentice to morally aware adult mirrors the Renaissance itself — the simultaneous birth of knowledge and new forms of destruction.

**Themes:**
1. **The ethics of craft** — When does a maker become responsible for how their creation is used? The novel explores this through glassmaking but resonates with modern questions about technology and weapons
2. **Sight and blindness** — The optical metaphor runs throughout: lenses that reveal, glass that distorts, the things we choose not to see
3. **The price of belonging** — Enzo exists in a liminal space, tolerated in the Christian workshop but never fully accepted, valued for his skills but despised for his identity
4. **Fire as creator and destroyer** — The furnace that makes glass also consumes; the novel's imagery consistently returns to fire as both generative and annihilating

**Series Potential:** Planned trilogy. Book One (*The Feast of Ashes*) covers 1494–1497 and Enzo's discovery of the conspiracy. Book Two (*The Lens Grinder's War*) follows Enzo from 1498–1504 as he becomes entangled in Venetian intelligence operations during the Ottoman-Venetian wars. Book Three (*The Glass Republic*) covers 1509–1510 and the War of the League of Cambrai, with Enzo now a master glassmaker who must protect Murano itself from destruction. The connecting thread is Enzo's evolution from apprentice to master, and the broader question of Venice's survival.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *The Glassblower of Murano* by Marina Fiorato (Venetian glass setting, though this pitch goes much deeper into craft and politics)
- *An Instance of the Fingerpost* by Iain Pears (intellectual mystery in a precisely rendered historical setting, multiple layers of deception)
- *The Miniaturist* by Jessie Burton (artisan protagonist, moral mystery, atmospheric European city)

**Unique Selling Point:**
Murano's glassmaking tradition is world-famous but almost entirely unexplored in serious literary fiction — most treatments are romantic or superficial. This novel goes deep into the actual craft (furnace temperatures, glass chemistry, lens-grinding techniques) to create an immersive sensory world of fire, light, and molten material. The conspiracy plot gives it commercial momentum, the Jewish protagonist provides a vital outsider perspective on Renaissance Venice, and the trilogy structure allows for the kind of sweeping character development that builds devoted readerships. The optical weapon plot — based on real Renaissance-era speculation about "burning mirrors" — adds a thriller edge without requiring anachronistic technology.

**Research Feasibility:** VERY HIGH. Venetian history is among the most thoroughly documented in Europe. Murano's glassmaking traditions are extensively studied (see W. Patrick McCray's *Glassmaking in Renaissance Venice*, Luigi Zecchin's archival work). The Italian Wars of 1494–1510 are covered by a massive body of scholarship. Jewish life in Venice before and during the Ghetto period is well-documented (see Robert Davis and Benjamin Ravid's *The Jews of Early Modern Venice*). Renaissance optics — from Roger Bacon through Leonardo — are thoroughly covered in the history of science literature.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 105,000–120,000 (Book One)
- **Chapters:** 32–36
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Enzo); 1 secondary (Bardolino, used for 5–6 chapters to show the conspiracy from the inside)

## PITCH 4

### *River of Blue Beads*

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Adventure Literary

**Logline:** A Songhai ferryman's daughter on the Niger River in 1520s Timbuktu risks everything to smuggle banned manuscripts out of the city before a Moroccan-backed coup can destroy them.

**Elevator Pitch:**
Aminata Touré is twenty-two years old and she can read, which is the most dangerous thing about her. The daughter of a ferryman on the Niger River, she was secretly educated by a Sankore scholar who saw her brilliance and broke every social convention to teach her. Now, in 1526, the Songhai Empire under Askia Muhammad is fracturing from within — succession disputes, religious purges, and the growing influence of Moroccan agents are destabilizing the greatest center of learning in West Africa. When Aminata's mentor is arrested and his library threatened with destruction, she uses her knowledge of the river — its currents, its hidden channels, its network of traders and boatmen — to organize the smuggling of irreplaceable manuscripts out of Timbuktu. The novel brings to vivid life a city that most Western readers know only as a synonym for remoteness, revealing it as what it truly was: one of the great intellectual capitals of the world, a city of sandstone libraries, gold dust currency, and fierce scholarly debate, connected by the Niger River to a vast trading network spanning the Sahara and beyond.

**Time Period:** 1526–1529

**Setting:** Timbuktu and Gao in the Songhai Empire (present-day Mali); the Niger River and its network of tributaries, islands, and trading posts; the trans-Saharan trade routes to the north; the markets and scholarly quarters of Timbuktu, including the great mosques of Djinguereber and Sankore.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Aminata Touré
- **Age:** 22
- **Role:** Ferryman's daughter, secret scholar, river navigator
- **Wants:** To save the manuscripts that represent her intellectual heritage; deeper down, to be recognized as a scholar in her own right, not merely a smuggler or a ferryman's daughter
- **Strengths:** Intimate knowledge of the Niger River system (currents, seasonal floods, hidden channels), physical toughness, literacy in Arabic and Songhai, a network of contacts among river traders and boatmen built through her father's business, courage under pressure
- **Flaws:** Intellectual pride that sometimes blinds her to the practical concerns of the people she needs as allies; a tendency to see manuscripts as more important than people, which creates moral blind spots; difficulty trusting anyone completely, born from years of hiding her education

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** Askia Musa, a historical figure — one of Askia Muhammad's sons who seized power in a 1528 coup, bringing a more authoritarian and religiously rigid regime
- **Nature:** A political opportunist who uses religious orthodoxy as a tool to consolidate power; his campaign against certain scholarly traditions is both genuinely ideological and cynically political
- **Motivation:** Consolidating power by purging his father's allies, including the liberal scholarly establishment of Timbuktu; the manuscripts represent not just knowledge but the intellectual authority of a class he needs to break

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Aminata must transport hundreds of fragile manuscripts down the Niger River and into safe hiding places before Askia Musa's forces can seize or destroy them, navigating both physical dangers (river hazards, bandits, soldiers) and political ones (informers, shifting allegiances among river communities)
- **Internal:** Aminata must confront the contradiction at the heart of her identity — she has been taught to revere knowledge above all else, but the smuggling operation forces her to make agonizing choices about which manuscripts to save (she cannot save them all), effectively deciding what knowledge survives and what is lost
- **Intersection:** Each decision about what to save forces Aminata to examine her own values and biases. The external triage of the manuscripts becomes an internal reckoning with what she truly believes matters.

**Themes:**
1. **The fragility of knowledge** — How entire intellectual traditions can be destroyed in a single generation by political violence, and the ordinary people who risk everything to prevent it (directly relevant to modern book banning and cultural destruction)
2. **The river as memory** — The Niger River as a metaphor for cultural transmission, carrying ideas and goods and people the way it carries water — sometimes flooding, sometimes drying up, always moving
3. **The cost of being exceptional** — Aminata's education, which should be her greatest gift, is also what isolates her from her community and puts her in danger
4. **Africa's intellectual history** — Directly countering the Western myth of Africa as a continent without written traditions by dramatizing one of the world's great scholarly cultures

**Series Potential:** Standalone with strong sequel potential. A second book could follow the manuscripts' journey across the Sahara to Morocco, and a third could bring the story to 1591 and the Moroccan invasion that ultimately destroyed the Songhai Empire — with a descendant of Aminata's trying to save the manuscripts a second time.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi (West African setting, multigenerational potential, literary prestige)
- *The Book of Night Women* by Marlon James (literary historical fiction centering a Black female protagonist in an extraordinary situation)
- *The Shadow of the Wind* by Carlos Ruiz Zafón (bibliophilic mystery-adventure about saving endangered books)

**Unique Selling Point:**
The Timbuktu manuscript tradition is one of the great untold stories in English-language fiction. The real-life drama of manuscript preservation in Timbuktu — which continued into the 21st century, when librarians smuggled manuscripts out of the city during the 2012 jihadist occupation — gives this story immediate contemporary resonance. The novel centers a Black African woman as an intellectual hero in a setting that dismantles persistent Western myths about African history. The Niger River provides a natural adventure structure (the journey downriver) while the manuscript stakes give the plot both urgency and emotional depth. There is virtually no commercial competition in this space.

**Research Feasibility:** MODERATE-HIGH. The Songhai Empire is less exhaustively documented than European settings, but substantial scholarship exists: John Hunwick's *Timbuktu and the Songhay Empire*, the *Tarikh al-Sudan* and *Tarikh al-Fattash* (contemporary chronicles translated into English and French), Elias Saad's *Social History of Timbuktu*. The Timbuktu manuscripts themselves have been the subject of extensive modern documentation efforts. The Niger River geography and ecology are well-documented. Daily life details require more creative synthesis but are available through archaeological, anthropological, and travelers' accounts. The 2013 nonfiction book *The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu* by Joshua Hammer provides excellent contextual material.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 90,000–105,000
- **Chapters:** 26–30
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Aminata); 1 secondary (her father, Ousmane, whose river knowledge and contacts are essential but whose motivations are more pragmatic than idealistic — used for 4–5 chapters)

## PITCH 5

### *The Bitter Garden*
#### Book One of *The Apothecary's Daughter* duology

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Gothic Literary Mystery

**Logline:** An apothecary's daughter in 1660s Amsterdam investigates a series of poisonings among the city's wealthiest merchants, uncovering a conspiracy rooted in the tulip crash of a generation earlier.

**Elevator Pitch:**
In the autumn of 1664, three of Amsterdam's most prominent merchants die within six weeks of each other, each after suffering identical symptoms: blue-tinged fingernails, visual hallucinations, and catastrophic organ failure. The city's physicians call it plague. Margaretha "Griet" Dekker, the twenty-six-year-old daughter of a disgraced apothecary, knows it is poison — specifically, a sophisticated preparation of monkshood (aconite) combined with compounds she recognizes from her father's forbidden notebooks. Griet's father was ruined after the tulip crash of 1637, accused of selling poison to desperate speculators; he died in prison protesting his innocence. Now, almost thirty years later, someone is using his formulas. To find the poisoner, Griet must re-enter the world of botanical knowledge her father's disgrace made toxic, navigating Amsterdam's thriving but morally ambiguous apothecary trade, the city's flourishing botanical gardens (where science and commerce blur), and the drawing rooms of merchant dynasties still scarred by the tulip mania's fallout. The novel is steeped in the sensory world of the Dutch Golden Age — the smell of turpentine and linseed oil, the gleam of Delftware, the damp chill of canal houses, the lush danger of physic gardens.

**Time Period:** 1664–1665 (Book One); Book Two would cover 1665–1667, extending into the plague year and the Anglo-Dutch Wars

**Setting:** Amsterdam — canal houses, apothecary shops, the Hortus Botanicus, the VOC warehouses, the Oude Kerk neighborhood, the markets. Secondary locations include Leiden (university and botanical gardens) and a country estate outside Haarlem.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Margaretha "Griet" Dekker
- **Age:** 26
- **Role:** Unofficial apothecary (she cannot be licensed as a woman), herbalist, and botanical illustrator who makes her living doing piecework for licensed apothecaries
- **Wants:** To clear her father's name and reclaim his knowledge as legitimate science rather than criminal poison-craft; pragmatically, to earn enough to support her aging mother and younger brother
- **Strengths:** Encyclopedic knowledge of botanical pharmacology inherited from her father, a trained artist's eye for detail, methodical and patient investigative temperament, ability to move through different social strata (she serves both wealthy households and working-class neighborhoods)
- **Flaws:** Obsessive — once she latches onto a question, she cannot let go, even when pursuing it becomes self-destructive; emotionally guarded to the point of coldness, having learned early that vulnerability leads to exploitation; harbors a deep, unexamined rage toward the merchant class she blames collectively for her father's destruction

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** The poisoner is initially unknown (mystery structure); the broader antagonist is the merchant class network — specifically, the Syndicate of Six, an informal alliance of trading families whose fortunes were built on the ruins of the tulip crash
- **Nature:** The poisoner is methodical, patient, and operating from a grievance decades old — this is revenge served cold, executed with pharmaceutical precision
- **Motivation:** The murders are connected to specific actions taken during and after the tulip crash of 1637 — debts called in, families destroyed, fortunes stolen under the cover of financial chaos. The poisoner is settling accounts.

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Griet must identify the poisoner before they complete their list of targets — and before the authorities, who have no interest in admitting that Amsterdam's merchant elite are being systematically murdered, silence her investigation
- **Internal:** Griet must decide whether her father's knowledge — the botanical pharmacology she inherited — is a gift or a curse. The same knowledge that lets her identify the poison also means she could manufacture it. As she gets closer to the poisoner, she recognizes uncomfortable similarities between their worldview and her own suppressed rage.
- **Intersection:** The investigation forces Griet to reckon with the possibility that her father was not entirely innocent — that his knowledge occupied a gray area between medicine and poison, healing and harm, and that she occupies the same gray area.

**Themes:**
1. **The thin line between medicine and poison** — Literally and metaphorically, the novel explores how the same substance, the same knowledge, the same impulse can heal or destroy depending on intent and dosage
2. **The long shadow of financial trauma** — The tulip crash of 1637, a generation before the novel's events, has left invisible scars across Amsterdam's social fabric — a meditation on how economic catastrophe echoes through decades
3. **Women's knowledge, men's institutions** — Griet possesses expertise that the formal institutions of science refuse to recognize because of her gender, forcing her into an underground economy of knowledge
4. **The garden as Eden and laboratory** — The novel's botanical settings are both beautiful and deadly, reflecting the Dutch Golden Age's simultaneous love of beauty and capacity for ruthlessness

**Series Potential:** Planned duology. Book One covers the poisoning investigation and ends with a partial resolution — the immediate poisoner is identified, but the deeper conspiracy is revealed. Book Two follows Griet into 1665–1667 as the plague arrives in Amsterdam and the Anglo-Dutch Wars create new dangers, forcing her to use her apothecary skills on a much larger stage.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *The Miniaturist* by Jessie Burton (Dutch Golden Age setting, mystery elements, atmospheric, female protagonist navigating male-dominated world)
- *The Crimson Petal and the White* by Michel Faber (richly textured historical world, female protagonist in morally ambiguous territory, literary-commercial crossover)
- *The Luminaries* by Eleanor Catton (structurally ambitious historical mystery with a large cast and interweaving plotlines)

**Unique Selling Point:**
The Dutch Golden Age is having a cultural moment (Vermeer exhibitions, *The Miniaturist* and *Girl with a Pearl Earring*) but the published fiction rarely goes beyond painters and merchants. This novel opens up a new dimension of the period — its thriving pharmaceutical and botanical culture, which was as commercially important as painting but far less romanticized. The poisoning mystery provides a propulsive plot engine, while the tulip crash backstory gives the novel historical depth and thematic resonance with modern financial anxieties. The botanical details — the novel will be steeped in the sensory experience of growing, preparing, and administering plant-based medicines — create an immersive world unlike anything else on the market.

**Research Feasibility:** VERY HIGH. The Dutch Golden Age is one of the most documented periods in European history. Amsterdam's apothecary trade, botanical gardens, and pharmaceutical practices are well-studied (see Harold Cook's *Matters of Exchange*, Claudia Swan's work on botanical illustration). The tulip mania has an enormous bibliography. Daily life in Amsterdam — food, housing, clothing, social customs — is exhaustively documented through paintings, inventories, notarial records, and modern scholarship (Simon Schama's *The Embarrassment of Riches*, Anne Goldgar's *Tulipmania*). Toxicology history provides excellent material on aconite and other plant poisons.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 95,000–110,000 (Book One)
- **Chapters:** 30–34
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Griet); brief interludes from the poisoner's perspective (unnamed, 3–4 short chapters) to build suspense

## PITCH 6

### *The Salted Road*

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Adventure

**Logline:** A deaf muleteer on the 18th-century Peruvian silver road must deliver a cargo of contraband to Lima while navigating bandits, corrupt officials, and an Inquisition investigation that threatens her found family.

**Elevator Pitch:**
Catalina Quispe was born deaf in the mining town of Potosí in 1728, the daughter of a mestiza laundress and an Aymara miner who died of silicosis before she could walk. Unable to work in the mines or the markets, she found her calling in the one profession where her deafness is an advantage: she is a *harriera*, a muleteer, driving mule trains along the brutal high-altitude roads connecting Potosí's silver mines to the Pacific coast. Her mules don't care that she can't hear, and neither do the traders who value her reliability and her near-supernatural ability to read weather, terrain, and animal behavior through vibration and observation. In 1752, Catalina is hired for what seems like a routine cargo run to Lima, but she soon discovers that the sealed crates she's carrying contain Jesuit scientific instruments being smuggled out of the country ahead of the Society's expulsion. The journey from the altiplano to the coast becomes an odyssey through the astonishing landscapes and overlapping cultures of late-colonial Peru — Quechua villages, Spanish colonial towns, Afro-Peruvian coastal communities — as Catalina must decide how far she'll go to protect a cargo, and the people connected to it, that she never asked to carry.

**Time Period:** 1752–1753

**Setting:** The silver road from Potosí (present-day Bolivia) through Arequipa to Lima, Peru — encompassing the altiplano (high plateau, 4,000+ meters elevation), the Andes mountain passes, the Pacific coastal desert, and the colonial city of Lima. Specific locations include mining camps, *tambos* (roadside inns), Jesuit missions, Indigenous villages, and the outskirts of Lima.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Catalina Quispe
- **Age:** 24
- **Role:** Muleteer (*harriera*) on the Potosí–Lima silver road
- **Wants:** Financial independence sufficient to buy her own mule train (currently she works for a *harriero* boss); deeper down, to find or create a family, having lost her parents and never fully belonged to any community
- **Strengths:** Extraordinary environmental awareness — her deafness has sharpened her visual, tactile, and vibrational senses to a remarkable degree; she reads weather patterns, animal stress signals, terrain instability, and human body language with uncanny accuracy. Physical endurance honed by years of high-altitude work. Deep practical knowledge of mule handling, packing, and route-finding. Communicates through a personal sign language developed with her work crew, supplemented by lip-reading in Spanish and Quechua.
- **Flaws:** Profound distrust of institutions and authority (understandable given her life experience but limiting); emotional self-sufficiency that keeps people at a distance; a stubborn refusal to abandon a job once accepted, even when common sense demands it — her professional pride is the closest thing she has to an identity, and it can override her survival instincts

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** Don Esteban Vargas de la Cerda, a *corregidor* (colonial district magistrate) who has built a corrupt empire skimming from the silver trade, and who wants the Jesuit instruments for his own purposes (he believes they include maps to undiscovered silver deposits)
- **Nature:** Charming, intelligent, and utterly amoral — a product of the colonial system's worst incentives, who sees the people under his authority as resources to be extracted
- **Motivation:** Greed and ambition; he wants to use the Jesuit materials to locate new mineral deposits that would make him wealthy enough to return to Spain as a grandee. He also needs to suppress the Jesuit network before their political connections can threaten his position.

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Catalina must transport dangerous contraband across 1,500 kilometers of brutal terrain while being pursued by Don Esteban's agents, navigating bandits, mountain weather, and the colonial bureaucracy's checkpoints and inspections
- **Internal:** Catalina has survived by refusing attachments — people are unreliable, mules are not. But the journey forces her into dependency on and responsibility for a group of people (a Jesuit brother, an Afro-Peruvian freedwoman, two Quechua porters) who become, despite her resistance, a family. Her internal conflict is between the safety of isolation and the terrifying vulnerability of connection.
- **Intersection:** The physical journey mirrors the emotional one — the road from the isolated altiplano to the teeming coast is also Catalina's journey from isolation to community. The cargo she carries (instruments of knowledge) parallels the emotional baggage she must learn to share.

**Themes:**
1. **The body as instrument** — Catalina's deafness is not a disability narrative but an exploration of how different bodies experience and navigate the world; her physical relationship with landscape, weather, and animals is the novel's richest sensory register
2. **The colonial road as artery and scar** — The silver road is simultaneously a marvel of engineering and a monument to extraction, connecting cultures while draining resources
3. **Found family on the margins** — The novel's emotional core is the makeshift community forged on the road, composed of people whom colonial society has marginalized — an Indigenous deaf woman, an Afro-Peruvian freedwoman, a disgraced Jesuit, Quechua laborers
4. **The weight we carry** — Both literal (the mule cargo) and figurative (guilt, grief, responsibility), the novel explores what we choose to carry and what we must set down to survive

**Series Potential:** Standalone. The journey structure gives the novel a natural beginning, middle, and end. However, Catalina's character could sustain a follow-up novel set during the Tupac Amaru II rebellion of 1780, when the entire colonial transport system she depends on is thrown into chaos.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *News of the World* by Paulette Jiles (journey narrative, unlikely guardian figure, spare prose, landscape as character)
- *The Lacuna* by Barbara Kingsolver (Latin American historical setting, outsider protagonist navigating between cultures)
- *True Grit* by Charles Portis (determined young protagonist on a dangerous journey, tight prose, genre-literary crossover)

**Unique Selling Point:**
Colonial Peru is almost entirely absent from English-language historical fiction, despite being one of the most dramatically varied and culturally rich settings on earth — from the 4,000-meter altiplano to the Pacific coast, from Quechua villages to Spanish colonial cities to Afro-Peruvian communities. The deaf protagonist is not a gimmick but a genuine narrative innovation: Catalina's heightened non-auditory senses create a prose style dominated by vibration, texture, light, and the language of animal behavior, producing an immersive sensory experience unlike any other historical novel. The journey structure provides natural pacing, and the contraband plot provides thriller tension.

**Research Feasibility:** MODERATE-HIGH. Colonial Peru's silver trade is well-documented through Spanish administrative records and modern scholarship (see Kris Lane's *Potosí*, Jane Mangan's *Trading Roles*, Kenneth Andrien's work on colonial economics). Mule transport in the Andes is documented in both colonial sources and anthropological studies. Jesuit activities in South America are exhaustively recorded. The geography of the Potosí-to-Lima route is well-mapped and documented. Daily life details require synthesis from multiple sources but are available. Deaf history in colonial Latin America is thin but does not need to be extensive — Catalina's experience is rendered through her sensory world rather than through institutional deaf history.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 85,000–95,000
- **Chapters:** 24–28 (structured around stages of the journey)
- **POV characters:** 1 (Catalina only — the single POV reinforces the novel's sensory intimacy)

## PITCH 7

### *The Paper House*

**Genre/Subgenre:** Historical Fiction / Literary Domestic Drama

**Logline:** A Korean paper-maker's wife in 1790s Seoul must secretly rebuild her husband's ruined workshop while navigating a factional purge that threatens everyone connected to the banned Catholic underground.

**Elevator Pitch:**
In 1795, the Korean Peninsula is in the grip of a political and spiritual crisis. King Jeongjo of the Joseon dynasty is attempting radical reforms while court factions wage a shadow war for control. Into this volatile moment, the Sinyu Persecution has made Catholic converts — many of them from the educated *yangban* class — targets for arrest and execution. Seo Yun-hui is the wife of a *hanji* (traditional paper) maker whose workshop supplied the finest paper in Seoul to scholars, calligraphers, and court officials. When her husband is arrested on suspicion of Catholic sympathies — the paper workshop had been printing Catholic texts — Yun-hui must keep the business alive to feed her children and aging mother-in-law, while concealing the workshop's Catholic connections from investigators. The novel immerses readers in the vanishing world of Joseon-era Seoul: the *hanok* courtyard houses with their heated *ondol* floors, the seasonal rhythms of paper-making (mulberry bark harvested in winter, pulped in spring, sheets dried in summer), the bustling markets along the Cheonggyecheon stream, and the dangerous intellectual ferment of a society encountering Western ideas for the first time. It is a novel about a woman who discovers that the most radical act of resistance can be the quietest one — simply continuing to make paper when powerful forces want the presses to stop.

**Time Period:** 1795–1801 (culminating in the Sinyu Persecution of 1801)

**Setting:** Seoul (Hanyang) during the late Joseon dynasty — the paper-making workshop in the *jung-in* (middle-class) artisan district, the royal palace complex of Changdeokgung, the market streets, the Catholic safe houses hidden in *yangban* residences, and the countryside mulberry groves where bark is harvested. Brief sections in Suwon, where King Jeongjo is building his great fortress city of Hwaseong.

**Protagonist:**
- **Name:** Seo Yun-hui
- **Age:** 31
- **Role:** Paper-maker's wife who becomes the *de facto* operator of the workshop after her husband's arrest
- **Wants:** To secure her family's survival — her two young daughters, her arrested husband, her dependent mother-in-law; deeper down, to be recognized as the skilled artisan she has always been, not merely the wife of one
- **Strengths:** Master-level paper-making skills learned from her own mother (an unusual lineage — most paper-makers are male, but Yun-hui's mother was a widow who kept the craft alive); diplomatic intelligence that lets her manage relationships with suppliers, customers, and officials; physical stamina for the grueling paper-making process; quiet courage
- **Flaws:** Excessive caution that sometimes tips into paralysis — she has spent her life being careful, and the crisis demands boldness she struggles to summon; a tendency to sacrifice her own needs and desires so completely for her family that she loses sight of what she herself wants; suppressed resentment toward her husband, who made the dangerous Catholic connections without consulting her

**Antagonist:**
- **Who:** Inspector Cho Myeong-gyu, a mid-ranking official tasked with identifying and prosecuting members of the Catholic underground in Seoul
- **Nature:** A true believer in Confucian orthodoxy who sees Catholicism as a genuine threat to the social order; he is also a meticulous investigator, patient and observant, which makes him more dangerous than a zealot would be
- **Motivation:** Genuine ideological conviction combined with career ambition — successfully prosecuting the Catholic network would elevate him from obscure bureaucrat to powerful court figure

**Central Conflict:**
- **External:** Yun-hui must keep the paper workshop running (it is her family's only income) while concealing evidence that it was used to print Catholic texts, all under the watchful eye of Inspector Cho, who suspects the workshop and is methodically building a case
- **Internal:** Yun-hui must confront her complicated feelings about the Catholic faith her husband embraced without her — she is not a believer, but she has come to respect the community of converts and is horrified by the persecution; she must decide whether to risk everything for a faith she does not share but a community she has come to love
- **Intersection:** The paper itself is the nexus — the same sheets that carry classical Korean poetry and court documents also carried Catholic prayers and catechisms. Yun-hui's craft, the thing that defines her identity, is also the evidence that could destroy her family. Every sheet she makes is both an act of creation and a potential instrument of her undoing.

**Themes:**
1. **The power of the page** — Paper as technology, art, and weapon; the novel explores how the material substrate of ideas (the physical paper) carries its own politics and dangers
2. **Faith without belief** — Yun-hui's moral commitment to the Catholic community despite her own lack of faith explores the difference between religious conviction and ethical solidarity
3. **The invisible labor of women** — Yun-hui's paper-making skill, domestic management, and political navigation are all rendered invisible by a social system that credits men for women's work
4. **Tradition under siege** — The collision between Confucian orthodoxy and Catholic universalism as a lens for examining how societies metabolize (or reject) new ideas

**Series Potential:** Standalone with sequel potential. The novel ends in 1801 with the Sinyu Persecution's climax. A sequel could follow Yun-hui's eldest daughter into the 1830s and 1840s, when Korean Catholics faced renewed persecution and the first French missionaries arrived — extending the story of paper, faith, and resistance into the next generation.

**Comparable Titles:**
- *Pachinko* by Min Jin Lee (Korean setting, multigenerational potential, literary prestige, domestic focus on a resilient woman)
- *The Personal Librarian* by Marie Benedict and Victoria Christopher Murray (woman concealing a dangerous identity while managing a cultural institution)
- *A Gentleman in Moscow* by Amor Towles (confined setting that becomes a microcosm for larger political forces, warm but intelligent tone)

**Unique Selling Point:**
The late Joseon dynasty is virtually unexplored in English-language fiction — the few Korean-set historical novels (*Pachinko*, *The Vegetarian*) are set in the modern era. This novel opens an entirely new world for Western readers: the aesthetic beauty of *hanok* architecture, *hanji* paper-making, and Joseon-era Seoul, combined with the dramatic story of Korea's first encounter with Christianity and the political turmoil it ignited. The paper-making craft provides extraordinary sensory material (the process of turning mulberry bark into translucent sheets is visually and tactilely rich), and the domestic scale of the story — a woman trying to keep her workshop and family intact — makes the political themes personal and accessible. *Pachinko*'s success demonstrates a large and growing readership for Korean-set literary fiction.

**Research Feasibility:** MODERATE. Joseon-era Korea is documented through Korean-language scholarship (the *Annals of the Joseon Dynasty* are available in translation), Jesuit and French missionary accounts, and a growing body of English-language academic work (see JaHyun Kim Haboush's *The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong*, Don Baker's work on Korean Catholicism). Traditional *hanji* paper-making is a UNESCO-recognized cultural heritage practice with extensive documentation. Daily life details — food, clothing, housing, social customs — are available through museum collections, reconstructed *hanok* villages, and Korean cultural heritage documentation. The Sinyu Persecution is well-documented in both Korean and Western missionary records. The primary challenge is that some detailed sources exist only in Korean, but sufficient English-language material exists for a well-researched novel.

**Estimated Scope:**
- **Word count:** 90,000–105,000
- **Chapters:** 28–32
- **POV characters:** 1 primary (Yun-hui); 1 secondary (Inspector Cho, used for 5–6 chapters to show the investigation from the outside and build tension)

# RECOMMENDATION

**Primary recommendation: Pitch 3, *The Feast of Ashes*.** This pitch scores highest across the evaluation matrix and deserves that ranking. Venice and Murano in the 1490s offer an unmatched combination of sensory richness (molten glass, furnace heat, canal light, Renaissance architecture) and research feasibility (Venetian archives are among the most complete in Europe). The glassmaking craft provides a natural engine for vivid, original prose — very few novels have gone deep into the actual practice of furnace work and lens grinding — while the conspiracy thriller plot gives the book the kind of propulsive momentum that drives commercial sales. The Jewish protagonist provides a built-in outsider perspective that deepens the novel's thematic texture without requiring the story to be *about* Judaism in a way that would demand specialized knowledge. Most critically for an AI-assisted pipeline, the planned trilogy structure offers a roadmap for sustained production: Book One is self-contained enough to succeed on its own, but the Italian Wars provide a ready-made escalating backdrop for two sequels. The research base is enormous and well-organized, and the period's visual culture (paintings, architecture, artifacts) provides abundant reference material for sensory detail.

**However, *The Bitter Garden* (Pitch 5) is a close second and should be considered as an alternative.** Its Dutch Golden Age setting is similarly well-documented, the mystery structure is inherently well-suited to AI-assisted plotting (mysteries have clear structural logic that can be outlined in advance), and the botanical/pharmaceutical content offers a sensory palette — gardens, laboratories, toxins, remedies — that is both distinctive and deeply researched. The poisoning mystery provides the strongest pure plot engine of any pitch on the list, and the tulip crash backstory gives the novel a thematic resonance with contemporary financial anxiety that could drive media coverage and book club adoption. Its duology structure is also more manageable than a trilogy for a first project.

**A final note on *River of Blue Beads* (Pitch 4) and *The Salted Road* (Pitch 6):** These rank lower on the composite score primarily due to research feasibility concerns, not because they are less compelling as stories. Both occupy almost completely empty market niches — there is virtually no commercial competition for literary historical fiction set in the Songhai Empire or colonial Peru — which means that if the research challenges can be managed, either could become a breakout title. *River of Blue Beads* in particular has a built-in publicity hook (the real-life Timbuktu manuscript rescue of 2012–2013) that no other pitch on this list can match. If the editorial team is willing to invest additional research resources, either of these should be reconsidered for development. They represent the highest risk but also the highest potential reward in terms of market positioning and critical attention.
