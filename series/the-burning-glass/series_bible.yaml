    Enzo Sforno evolves from a naive, talented apprentice (Book 1) to a morally

    - "Glass as metaphor: clarity vs. distortion, beauty vs. weapon, fragility vs. strength"
    - "The Jewish experience in Renaissance Venice: tolerance as transaction, belonging as performance"
    - "Venice itself as a glass creation — magnificent, fragile, built on water"
    - "The birth of modern warfare and the craftsman's complicity"
  historical_backdrop: >
    The Italian Wars (1494–1559) reshaped Europe. Venice, which entered the period as
    the Mediterranean's dominant naval and commercial power, was nearly destroyed by the
    League of Cambrai in 1509. The trilogy tracks Venice's arc from confidence to crisis,
    mirrored in Enzo's personal journey.
