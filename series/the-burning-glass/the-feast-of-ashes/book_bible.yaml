  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - full_name: "Enzo Sforno"
    aliases:
      - "the Jew boy" # what hostile workers call him
      - "Sforno's pup" # what older furnace hands call him, referencing his father
      - "little lens" # Serena's private nickname for him
    role: protagonist
    birth_year: 1477
    age_at_story_start: 17
    death_date: null

    physical:
      height: "average, about 168 cm — neither tall nor short for the period"
      build: "lean and wiry from furnace work, strong hands disproportionate to his frame"
      hair: "dark brown, thick, curly, kept short but unruly; often dusted with grinding powder"
      eyes: "dark brown, nearly black; remarkably sharp — he can spot flaws in glass others miss"
      skin: "olive, tanned darker on the face and forearms from furnace heat"
      distinguishing_features:
        - "roughened fingertips from years of lens grinding, with white grit permanently in the creases"
        - "a small burn scar on his left wrist from a splatter of molten glass, age fourteen"
        - "slightly hunched left shoulder from hours bent over the grinding table"
      clothing_style: >
        Simple working-class attire: a linen shirt, wool doublet (usually unbuttoned
        at the furnace), hose, leather apron when grinding. Wears the required yellow
        circle (rotella gialla) sewn onto his doublet over the chest. On Shabbat,
        a cleaner doublet of darker wool. A felt cap pulled low. His clothes always
        carry a faint chemical smell from the furnace.

    personality:
      traits:
        - "intensely observant — notices details others overlook, a lens grinder's eye"
        - "stubbornly loyal to the few people he trusts"
        - "morally binary — sees the world in right and wrong, slow to accept ambiguity"
        - "quietly proud — refuses to show pain or ask for help"
        - "privately angry — suppresses resentment about anti-Jewish prejudice until it erupts"
        - "obsessive when curious — cannot leave a puzzle unsolved"
      values:
        - "craftsmanship and precision"
        - "family loyalty"
        - "honesty (which makes Venice dangerous for him)"
        - "his father's memory and legacy"
      fears:
        - "being expelled from Murano and losing his craft"
        - "that his father's death was meaningless"
        - "that his skill makes him a tool for powerful men, not a free artisan"
        - "becoming invisible — tolerated but never truly seen"
      habits:
        - "holds objects up to the light and rotates them slowly when thinking"
        - "rubs his right thumb across his roughened left fingertips when nervous"
        - "eats quickly and silently, a habit from being the outsider at the workshop table"
        - "walks with his head slightly tilted, as if examining the world from an angle"
      speech_patterns:
        - "speaks Venetian dialect at the furnace, Italian with educated speakers, Hebrew at home"
        - "tends toward short, precise sentences — a craftsman's economy"
        - "uses visual metaphors instinctively: 'clear as cristallo,' 'clouded,' 'fractured'"
        - "rarely raises his voice; when truly angry, he becomes quieter, not louder"
        - "occasionally uses Hebrew words when emotional, then catches himself"

    background:
      origin: "born in Venice, raised in the Cannaregio district near the future Ghetto site"
      education: >
        Torah study and Hebrew literacy through the Jewish community. Basic Latin
        from a sympathetic parish priest who recognized his intelligence. Self-taught
        in optics through his father's books and instruments. Can read but writes
        slowly. Numerate — can calculate lens curvatures in his head.
      occupation: "apprentice lens grinder in the Bardolino furnace, Murano"
      social_class: "Jewish artisan — outside the Christian class hierarchy entirely"
      family:
        father: "Giacomo Sforno (deceased 1493) — master lens grinder, died in furnace explosion"
        mother: "Mirela Sforno (nee Modena) — alive, keeps household in Cannaregio"
        siblings: null
      religion: "Jewish (Italian rite — Italkim tradition, neither Ashkenazi nor Sephardi)"

    arc:
      want: "to earn maestro credentials and understand why his father died"
      need: "to accept that the world is morally complex and that good people do terrible things"
      ghost: >
        His father's death in a furnace explosion when Enzo was sixteen. Enzo was
        nearby and heard the blast. He arrived to find the furnace shattered and his
        father's body burned beyond recognition. He was told it was an accident —
        a cracked crucible, a steam explosion. He has never fully believed this.
      lie: "if I am skilled enough and useful enough, they will have to accept me and keep me safe"
      truth: >
        Skill alone cannot protect you in a world run by power. Safety comes not
        from being indispensable but from understanding who holds power and why.
        And moral clarity requires acting even when the cost is everything you have built.

    relationships:
      - character: "Vittorio Bardolino"
        nature: "master and apprentice; surrogate father figure"
        history: "Vittorio took Enzo on after Giacomo's death, honoring an old debt to the father"
        evolution: "trust and gratitude curdle into betrayal as Enzo discovers Vittorio's secret work"
      - character: "Mirela Sforno"
        nature: "mother and son; protective, sometimes suffocating"
        history: "they clung to each other after Giacomo's death; Mirela fears losing Enzo too"
        evolution: "Enzo begins keeping secrets from her; she reveals she has secrets of her own"
      - character: "Tomaso Bardolino"
        nature: "rival, antagonist, fellow worker"
        history: "Tomaso resents Enzo's skill and his father's favoritism toward the Jewish outsider"
        evolution: "hostility deepens as Tomaso suspects Enzo is snooping; uneasy truce late in story"
      - character: "Serena Contarini"
        nature: "friend, potential romantic interest"
        history: "met as children when Enzo accompanied his father to the Contarini furnace"
        evolution: "friendship deepens into something more; complicated by religion and social barriers"
      - character: "Fra Giordano"
        nature: "intellectual fascination and moral horror"
        history: "Enzo encounters Fra Giordano's ideas before meeting the man"
        evolution: "drawn to his brilliance, repelled by his willingness to weaponize knowledge"
      - character: "Marcantonio Viaro"
        nature: "handler, manipulator, dangerous ally"
        history: "Viaro approaches Enzo after recognizing his potential usefulness"
        evolution: "Enzo becomes an unwilling informant; the relationship becomes a trap"

    voice_notes: >
      Enzo speaks with the directness of a craftsman. His vocabulary is concrete —
      glass, light, heat, tools. He does not use flowery language. When under
      stress, his sentences shorten to fragments. He thinks in images, not
      abstractions. Internal monologue should reflect his visual acuity — he
      notices what things look like before anything else.

  # VITTORIO BARDOLINO — Secondary POV / Antagonist
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - full_name: "Vittorio Bardolino"
    aliases:
      - "Maestro Bardolino"
      - "the old lion" # what the serventi call him behind his back
      - "Vittorio the Steady" # his reputation among Murano masters
    role: antagonist
    birth_year: 1439
    age_at_story_start: 55
    death_date: null

    physical:
      height: "tall for the era, about 175 cm; carries himself with a craftsman's dignity"
      build: "broad-shouldered, thick-armed from decades at the furnace; beginning to soften at the belly"
      hair: "iron grey, receding, worn swept back; a short-trimmed grey beard"
      eyes: "pale grey-blue — watery from years of furnace glare; bloodshot by late afternoon"
      skin: "weathered, ruddy, lined deeply around the eyes and mouth; old burn scars on both forearms"
      distinguishing_features:
        - "hands are enormous, scarred, calloused — the hands of a man who has shaped molten glass for forty years"
        - "missing the tip of his left ring finger, lost to shears in his twenties"
        - "a slight limp in his right leg from an old injury, worse in cold weather"
      clothing_style: >
        At the furnace: simple linen shirt, leather apron, wooden clogs. In public:
        a respectable wool robe of dark blue or brown, befitting a master craftsman.
        On formal occasions, a fur-trimmed mantle. Wears a gold signet ring with
        the Bardolino furnace mark (a rampant lion holding a goblet) on his right hand.

    personality:
      traits:
        - "paternally authoritative — runs his furnace like a family, expects obedience and gives protection"
        - "genuinely passionate about the craft — can talk about glass for hours with real wonder"
        - "financially anxious — the furnace is failing and he lies awake calculating debts"
        - "self-deceptive — convinces himself that compromises are temporary"
        - "proud to the point of stubbornness — cannot admit when he has gone too far"
        - "capable of real warmth, which makes his betrayal more painful"
      values:
        - "the furnace and the family name"
        - "the Murano tradition — he sees himself as a guardian of centuries of craft"
        - "loyalty (which he violates, and knows he violates)"
        - "order and hierarchy"
      fears:
        - "the furnace closing and the Bardolino name dying"
        - "being exposed as a traitor to guild secrecy"
        - "that the weapon will actually work and he will bear responsibility"
        - "losing control of events he set in motion"
      habits:
        - "turns a small piece of millefiori glass in his pocket when anxious — a piece he made as a young man"
        - "rubs his missing fingertip against his thumb unconsciously"
        - "tastes the batch ingredients by touching a wet finger to the raw materials"
        - "stands at the furnace mouth for long minutes, staring into the fire, when troubled"
      speech_patterns:
        - "speaks in Venetian dialect with Murano inflections — broader vowels, older forms"
        - "uses furnace metaphors: 'the fire will tell you,' 'a cracked pot leaks before it breaks'"
        - "voice is deep, hoarse from years of shouting over furnace noise"
        - "becomes formally polite when frightened — a sign Enzo learns to read"
        - "tells stories about old maestri to make indirect points"

    background:
      origin: "born on Murano, third generation of the Bardolino glassmaking family"
      education: "guild apprenticeship from age twelve; basic literacy; no Latin or formal schooling"
      occupation: "maestro vetraio — master glassmaker, owner of the Bardolino furnace"
      social_class: "Murano craft aristocracy — registered in the Libro d'Oro of Murano"
      family:
        wife: "Alessandra Bardolino (nee Serena) — deceased 1491, fever"
        son: "Tomaso Bardolino — age 20, servente in the furnace"
        daughter: "Caterina Bardolino — age 16, lives with Vittorio"
      religion: "Catholic, conventionally observant"

    arc:
      want: "to save the Bardolino furnace and secure his family's legacy"
      need: "to accept that some prices are too high, even for legacy"
      ghost: >
        His father ran the furnace into the ground through gambling debts. Vittorio
        spent his twenties rebuilding what his father nearly destroyed. The terror
        of losing the furnace again drives every decision.
      lie: "the weapon will never actually work, so manufacturing the components is a victimless act"
      truth: >
        Complicity in evil is not lessened by believing the evil will fail.
        The act of making the weapon's components is itself the moral failure,
        regardless of whether the weapon functions.

    relationships:
      - character: "Enzo Sforno"
        nature: "master to apprentice; genuine affection complicated by exploitation"
        history: "owes a debt to Giacomo Sforno; took Enzo on partly from guilt"
        evolution: "from protector to betrayer; final attempt at redemption"
      - character: "Tomaso Bardolino"
        nature: "father and son; strained by Vittorio's visible preference for Enzo's talent"
        history: "Tomaso is competent but not brilliant; Vittorio cannot hide his disappointment"
        evolution: "the conspiracy forces them into reluctant alliance"
      - character: "Fra Giordano"
        nature: "uneasy collaborators; Vittorio fears the friar's fanaticism"
        history: "Fra Giordano approached Vittorio through a Council of Ten intermediary"
        evolution: "Vittorio grows increasingly horrified as the weapon takes shape"
      - character: "Marcantonio Viaro"
        nature: "handler and puppet master; Viaro controls Vittorio through promises and threats"
        history: "Viaro arranged the commission and the promise of a Council advisory seat"
        evolution: "Vittorio realizes too late that Viaro will never let him walk away"

    voice_notes: >
      Vittorio speaks with the authority of a man used to being obeyed in his own
      domain. His POV chapters should feel heavier, more burdened than Enzo's —
      the weight of knowledge and guilt. He thinks in terms of fire and materials,
      the tangible world. His internal monologue should reveal the gap between what
      he tells himself and what he knows is true.

    role: antagonist
    birth_year: 1449
    age_at_story_start: 45
    death_date: null

    physical:
      height: "short, about 160 cm — compensates with intensity of presence"
      build: "thin to the point of gauntness; eats irregularly, forgets meals when working"
      hair: "tonsured crown, fringe of dark hair going grey; unkempt"
      eyes: "dark, large, feverishly bright — the most memorable thing about him"
      skin: "sallow, pockmarked from a childhood illness"
      distinguishing_features:
        - "ink-stained fingers that never come fully clean"
        - "a nervous energy that keeps him in constant small motion — tapping, pacing, gesturing"
        - "voice carries disproportionately for his size; trained as a preacher"
      clothing_style: >
        The grey-brown Franciscan habit, rope belt with three knots, leather sandals.
        His habit is stained with ink and wax. Carries a leather satchel bulging
        with manuscripts and loose papers everywhere he goes.

    personality:
      traits:
        - "intellectually brilliant — genuinely one of the sharpest minds in Italy"
        - "obsessive — once seized by an idea, nothing else exists"
        - "charismatic in person — can make you believe anything while he is talking"
        - "self-righteous — convinced his work serves God and Christendom"
        - "emotionally stunted — relates to ideas, not people"
        - "capable of cruelty through indifference rather than malice"
      values:
        - "knowledge and its application"
        - "the defense of Christendom against the Ottoman threat"
        - "his intellectual legacy"
        - "the Franciscan tradition of Roger Bacon, whom he idolizes"
      fears:
        - "dying before completing his work"
        - "that his ideas will be stolen or credited to others"
        - "irrelevance — being just another friar in a crumbling monastery"
      habits:
        - "quotes Roger Bacon in Latin without preamble, assuming everyone can follow"
        - "draws optical diagrams on any available surface — tables, walls, margins of books"
        - "speaks to himself when working through problems"
        - "fasts erratically, then eats ravenously"
      speech_patterns:
        - "speaks rapidly, leaping between ideas, expecting listeners to keep up"
        - "mixes Latin, Italian, and technical terms freely"
        - "uses theological language to justify secular ambitions: 'God's light,' 'the fire of truth'"
        - "interrupts constantly; barely listens to others"
        - "when excited, his voice rises to a near-shout"

    background:
      origin: "born in Padua to a minor merchant family"
      education: >
        Entered the Franciscan order at sixteen. Studied natural philosophy at
        the University of Padua. Read Alhazen, Bacon, Witelo, and Pecham. Spent
        years in monastery libraries studying optical manuscripts. Traveled to
        Florence, Bologna, and Rome consulting rare texts.
      occupation: "Franciscan friar; unofficial natural philosopher and optical theorist"
      social_class: "clergy — technically outside secular hierarchy but dependent on patronage"
      religion: "Franciscan Catholic — heterodox in practice, orthodox in self-image"

    arc:
      want: "to build the burning glass and prove his genius"
      need: "to recognize that knowledge without moral restraint is destruction, not creation"
      ghost: >
        Spent years being dismissed by university scholars who mocked his
        Franciscan education and his obsession with Bacon's 'fantasies.' The
        weapon is his proof that he was right all along.
      lie: "a weapon that saves Christendom cannot be evil, regardless of how it kills"
      truth: "the light that burns is still fire, and fire does not distinguish between the righteous and the innocent"

    relationships:
      - character: "Vittorio Bardolino"
        nature: "uneasy alliance; needs Vittorio's skill but disdains his caution"
        history: "introduced through Viaro; Giordano provides designs, Vittorio executes"
        evolution: "growing contempt for what Giordano sees as Vittorio's cowardice"
      - character: "Enzo Sforno"
        nature: "fascination with Enzo's natural talent; sees him as a potential disciple"
        history: "learns of Enzo through Vittorio; recognizes Giacomo Sforno's legacy"
        evolution: "attempts to recruit Enzo; their intellectual connection is genuine but dangerous"
      - character: "Marcantonio Viaro"
        nature: "patron and handler; Giordano resents Viaro's control but needs his protection"
        history: "Viaro recognized Giordano's potential and arranged state sponsorship"
        evolution: "Giordano increasingly chafes against Viaro's demands for results"

    voice_notes: >
      Fra Giordano should sound brilliant and terrifying in equal measure. His
      dialogue crackles with intelligence. He sees connections others miss. But there
      is a void where empathy should be. When he describes the weapon's potential,
      he speaks of light and geometry, never of burning flesh. His POV (if used)
      should be dazzling and unsettling.

  # THE BARDOLINO FURNACE
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: "The Bardolino Furnace"
    aliases:
      - "the fornace"
      - "Bardolino's"
    type: "building / workshop"
    region: "Murano, Venice"
    coordinates: "on the Fondamenta dei Vetrai, the main canal-side street of Murano's glassmaking district"

    physical_description:
      exterior: >
        A substantial rectangular building of dark brick, two stories, with a tall
        chimney that leaks pale smoke when the furnace is running. The facade faces
        the Fondamenta dei Vetrai. A wooden dock for supply boats extends into the
        canal. The building is old — cracks in the brickwork, replaced roof tiles,
        a general air of fading prosperity. A painted sign of a rampant lion holding
        a goblet (the Bardolino mark) hangs above the door, its colors peeling.
      interior: >
        Ground floor: the main workshop, dominated by the beehive-shaped furnace
        (roughly 2.5 meters in diameter, 2 meters tall) in the center. Multiple
        bocche (working openings) at waist height. An annealing oven (the tempera)
        is connected to the east wall. Wooden racks for tools along the north wall.
        A marver (marble working surface) near the furnace. Storage bins for raw
        materials (quartz pebbles, soda ash, manganese, colorants) along the south
        wall. A large wooden table for batch mixing. The floor is brick, cracked
        and stained.

        A storeroom at the rear of the ground floor, behind a locked door. This is
        where Vittorio keeps the secret components. It contains wooden crates packed
        with straw, inside which are oversized cristallo lens blanks — much larger
        than any spectacle lens (20-30 cm diameter). Also stored here: brass
        grinding forms of unusual curvature, technical drawings on vellum (Fra
        Giordano's diagrams), and a strongbox with correspondence.

        Upper floor: Vittorio's office/study and living quarters. The office
        contains a heavy walnut desk, account books, the furnace's copy of the
        guild mariegola, a shelf of rare glass samples, and a locked cabinet
        containing the project correspondence.
      atmosphere: >
        During working hours: infernal heat, orange light, constant noise, intense
        energy. The furnace is the beating heart, and everything orbits around it.
        At night or on rest days: eerie silence, residual warmth, the glow of
        banked coals through the bocche. The storeroom has a different quality —
        cool, silent, the air thick with secrets.

    sensory_details:
      sight:
        - "the orange-white glow of molten glass through the bocche"
        - "heat shimmer distorting the air above the furnace"
        - "flying sparks when wood is added to the fire"
        - "the mesmerizing fluidity of a gather of molten glass on the end of a blowpipe"
        - "dust motes suspended in shafts of light from high windows"
      sound:
        - "the constant low roar of the furnace fire"
        - "the hiss of hot glass on the cool marble marver"
        - "shouted commands in Venetian dialect over the noise"
        - "the clink of metal tools, the scrape of the pontil"
        - "the rhythmic grinding sound from Enzo's lens-grinding station"
      smell:
        - "hot metal and woodsmoke"
        - "a sharp chemical tang from volatilized soda ash"
        - "wet wood from soaked molds, steaming when hot glass touches them"
        - "sweat — the furnace workers are always drenched"
        - "the faint dusty mineral smell of raw silica"
      touch:
        - "brutal radiant heat from the furnace, baking exposed skin"
        - "the shock of cool air when stepping outside"
        - "the rough texture of the blowpipe in the hands"
        - "fine grit of grinding compound working into the creases of the fingers"
        - "the floor vibrating slightly from the intensity of the fire"
      taste:
        - "metallic tang on the tongue near the furnace"
        - "dry, chalky dust from silica and batch materials"
        - "cheap wine and bread at the midday break"

    significance_to_plot: >
      The central location of the novel. Where Enzo works, where the secret
      components are manufactured, where the conspiracy hides in plain sight.
      The storeroom is the physical embodiment of the secret.

    region: "Cannaregio, Venice"

    physical_description:
      exterior: >
        A narrow, three-story tenement building on a small canal in the Cannaregio
        district, near the area that will become the Ghetto in 1516. The building
        is shared with two other families. The Sfornos occupy two rooms on the
        second floor. The facade is crumbling plaster over brick, stained with damp.
        A narrow stone staircase leads up from the calle (street). A small landing
        at the second floor with the Sforno door — a mezuzah fixed to the right
        doorpost.
      interior: >
        Two rooms. The main room serves as kitchen, dining room, and living space.
        A small brazier for cooking. A wooden table, two stools, a chest for
        linens. Shelves holding dishes (separate sets for meat and dairy, per
        kashrut), a kiddush cup, Shabbat candlesticks. Herbs hung from the
        ceiling beam. Giacomo's old workbench is pushed against one wall — Mirela
        cannot bring herself to discard it. On it, his lens-grinding tools remain
        as he left them.

        The second room is a small sleeping chamber. A bed for Mirela, a pallet
        for Enzo (when he sleeps at home rather than at the furnace). A clothes
        chest. A shelf with a few books — a Hebrew Bible, a prayer book, a worn
        copy of a Talmudic commentary that belonged to Giacomo's father.
      atmosphere: >
        Small, modest, clean. Mirela keeps it spotless. It smells of cooking,
        dried herbs, and the faint damp of a Venetian building. On Friday evenings,
        it transforms: candles lit, challah on the table, the kiddush cup filled,
        and for an hour the cramped rooms feel like a sanctuary.

    sensory_details:
      sight:
        - "the warm yellow of Shabbat candles on white linen"
        - "Giacomo's tools on the workbench — grinding forms, calipers, a small lathe — untouched"

        - "the thin straw mattress of Enzo's pallet"
      taste:
        - "Mirela's Shabbat meal — fried fish, bean soup, challah, cheap sweet wine for kiddush"

    significance_to_plot: >
      Enzo's anchor and refuge. The place where his Jewish identity is whole and
      uncompromised. Giacomo's workbench is a silent presence — and eventually
      yields clues when Enzo searches it.

    physical_description:
      exterior: >
        The commercial heart of Venice, centered on the wooden Rialto bridge
        (the stone bridge was not built until 1588-1591). The western bank holds
        the produce market (Erberia), fish market (Pescheria), and meat market.
        The eastern bank is the financial center — bankers at open-air tables
        (banchi), merchants negotiating, currencies being exchanged. The bridge
        itself is crowded with shops built along its length. Below, the Grand
        Canal is thick with boats.
      interior: null # outdoor/open location
      atmosphere: >
        Overwhelming sensory assault. The loudest, most crowded, most alive place

      interior: >
        A single room crammed floor to ceiling with books — printed volumes from
        the new Venetian presses (including Aldus Manutius's editions), manuscript
        copies of older works, pamphlets, maps, astronomical charts. A table piled
        with open volumes. A reading lectern. A small back room where Gritti does
        bookbinding repairs. The smell of paper, ink, leather, and glue is
        overwhelming. Barely enough room for two people to stand.
      atmosphere: >
        A sanctuary of knowledge. Quiet after the roar of the Rialto. Dust

      - "barred from certain areas during Christian holy days"
      - "worship must be private and quiet"
      - "the condotta can be revoked at any time by Senate vote"
    grey_areas: >
      In practice, enforcement is inconsistent. Some restrictions are routinely
      violated with tacit tolerance. Jewish physicians serve patrician families.
      Jewish artisans work in Christian workshops through informal arrangements.
      Enzo's position at the Bardolino furnace is one such grey area — he works
      as a 'personal servant' to Vittorio, technically not a guild apprentice.
    enzo_specific: >
      Enzo's presence on Murano requires Vittorio's active protection. If
      Vittorio withdraws that protection, Enzo can be expelled immediately.
      This is part of Vittorio's leverage, though he has never explicitly
      threatened it.

  guild_hierarchy:
    description: >
      The Murano glass industry is organized as follows:
    ranks:
      - rank: "Maestro (Master)"
        authority: "full control of a furnace team; the artistic and technical head"
        requirements: "completion of apprenticeship, demonstration of mastery, guild approval"
      - rank: "Servente (Journeyman/Assistant)"
        authority: "skilled worker under the maestro's direction"
        requirements: "completed apprenticeship, approved by guild"
      - rank: "Garzone (Apprentice)"
        authority: "none; bound to the maestro for the term of apprenticeship"
        requirements: "typically 5-7 year term; begins age 12-14"
      - rank: "Fonditore (Melter/Batch mixer)"
        authority: "responsible for raw materials and melting; answers to the maestro"
      - rank: "Temperaor (Annealer)"
        authority: "manages the annealing oven; answers to the maestro"
    governance: >
      The guild is headed by a gastaldo (head) and a board of officials
      elected by master glassmakers. The guild reports to the Giustizia
      Vecchia (Venetian magistrates overseeing guilds and trade). Above
      them, the Council of Ten has ultimate authority over state secrets
      including glass technology.

  the_weapon:
    concept: "a focusing array that concentrates sunlight into a directed beam capable of igniting targets at range"
    theoretical_basis: >
      Roger Bacon's writings on burning mirrors and lenses. The legend of
      Archimedes at Syracuse. Leonardo da Vinci's concurrent work on concave
      mirrors in Milan (unknown to the Venetian project but thematically parallel).
    components:
      primary_lenses:
        description: "six to eight large cristallo lenses, each 20-30 cm diameter, ground to precise convex curvatures"
        manufacturer: "Vittorio Bardolino (glass blanks) and originally Giacomo Sforno, now Enzo (grinding)"
        current_location: "Bardolino furnace storeroom, in straw-packed crates"
      focusing_array_frame:
        description: "a precision brass framework that holds and aligns the lenses to concentrate light on a single focal point"
        manufacturer: "Arsenal metalworkers, under Viaro's direction"
        current_location: "components stored at the Arsenal"
      sighting_mechanism:
        description: "a pair of smaller lenses in a tube — effectively a crude telescope — for aiming the array"
        manufacturer: "the tube and mount from Arsenal smiths; the lenses from the Bardolino furnace"
        current_location: "not yet assembled at novel's start"
      mounting_platform:
        description: "a wooden and metal platform designed to be mounted on a galley's bow"
        manufacturer: "Arsenal shipwrights"
        current_location: "in design phase"
    operational_theory: >
      Multiple large lenses arranged in a frame, each angled to direct
      concentrated sunlight toward a single focal point at a range of
      approximately 30-50 meters. At the focal point, the combined energy
      could theoretically ignite pitch, sailcloth, or other flammable
      materials on an enemy ship. Effective only in direct sunlight.
      A sighting tube allows targeting.
    limitations:
      - "requires clear, direct sunlight — useless in overcast conditions, rain, or at night"
      - "effective range limited to perhaps 30-50 meters — well within arrow/cannon range"
      - "the lenses must be perfectly aligned — any vibration or wave motion disrupts focus"
      - "the glass is fragile — a single impact could shatter the array"
      - "targets must be stationary or nearly so for the beam to dwell long enough to ignite"
    why_it_matters: >
      The weapon is probably impractical as designed. But the concept —
      focusing energy at a distance — and the accidental discovery of
      magnification through combined lenses (a proto-telescope) have
      implications far beyond this one device. It is the idea, not the
      execution, that is truly dangerous.

  - name: "The Primary Lenses"
    description: >
      Six large cristallo lens blanks, each approximately 25 cm in diameter
      and 3 cm thick at the center, tapering to about 1 cm at the edges
      (plano-convex profile). The glass is the finest cristallo — nearly
      colorless, with only the faintest grey tint. Each lens weighs
      approximately 2-3 kg.

        location: "Enzo sabotages them — introduces microscopic flaws in the curvature"
    significance: "the physical heart of the weapon; the objects that connect Enzo's father to the conspiracy"

  - name: "The Sighting Tube Lenses"
    description: >
      A pair of smaller lenses — one convex (approximately 8 cm diameter),
      one concave (approximately 5 cm diameter) — intended to be mounted in
      a brass tube to create a crude telescope for targeting the weapon.
    creator: "Enzo grinds these, not initially understanding their purpose"
    location_tracking:
      - period: "1495-1496"
        location: "Enzo's grinding station, then the storeroom"
    significance: "the accidental proto-telescope; represents the dual nature of the craft — same lenses that target a weapon could also expand human vision"

  - name: "The Brass Grinding Forms"
    description: >
      A set of convex and concave brass cups used for grinding the large
      lenses. Much larger than standard spectacle-grinding forms. Their
      curvatures are specified in Fra Giordano's diagrams.
    creator: "commissioned from a metalworker, possibly Arsenal-connected"
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "Bardolino furnace storeroom"
    significance: "the first anomaly Enzo notices — these forms do not match any known spectacle or mirror shape"

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # GIACOMO'S LEGACY
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: "Giacomo's Lens-Grinding Tools"
    description: >
      A set of lens-grinding equipment: a hand-turned grinding table (a
      wooden frame with a rotating disc), several sets of standard grinding
      forms (brass cups of various curvatures), calipers, a water-drip
      system, containers of emery of various grades, polishing rouge (iron
      oxide), felt pads, and a leather case of finished test lenses.
    creator: "accumulated by Giacomo over his career; some inherited from his own father"
    location_tracking:
      - period: "pre-1493"
        location: "Giacomo's workspace at the Bardolino furnace"
      - period: "1493 onward"
        location: "the Sforno house — moved there after Giacomo's death; Mirela preserved them on the old workbench"
    significance: "Enzo's inheritance, both practical and emotional. The tools connect him to his father's skill and eventually to his father's secret."

  - name: "Giacomo's Hidden Notes"
    description: >
      Several folded sheets of paper concealed in a false bottom of
      Giacomo's tool case (the leather case of test lenses). Written in
      Giacomo's hand in a mixture of Hebrew and Italian. They contain:
      lens curvature calculations matching the anomalous grinding forms,
      a partial sketch of a multi-lens array, and a final note that reads
      (in Hebrew): 'I will not grind what I cannot see the end of.'

      - period: "1496 onward"
        location: "Enzo keeps them hidden on his person or in a secret place"
    significance: >
      The key evidence that Giacomo knew what he was making — and refused
      to continue. This note is what convinced someone to silence him.
      It also proves to Enzo that his father died for a moral choice,
      not an accident.

  # THE LETTER
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: "Viaro's Commission Letter"
    description: >
      A letter on fine paper, sealed with an unmarked seal (no family
      crest — deliberate anonymity). Written in a formal hand, it
      authorizes Vittorio Bardolino to produce 'optical instruments for
      the service of the Republic' and guarantees payment of 500 ducats
      upon completion, plus 'such further honors as the Council shall
      determine.' The letter does not name the weapon explicitly — it
      uses euphemisms throughout. It is signed with a cipher rather
      than a name.
    creator: "Marcantonio Viaro, on behalf of his Council of Ten sponsors"

  # SYMBOLIC / RECURRING OBJECTS
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - name: "Vittorio's Millefiori Piece"
    description: >
      A small disc of millefiori glass, about 4 cm across, that Vittorio
      made as a young journeyman. Dozens of tiny flower-like colored
      elements fused together. He carries it in his pocket and turns it
      when anxious. It represents the beauty of the craft before it
      became entangled with war.
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "Vittorio's pocket"
    significance: "recurring symbol of what the craft should be vs. what it has become"

  - name: "Enzo's Test Lens"
    description: >
      A small convex lens, about 6 cm diameter, that Enzo ground as his
      first successful piece. Clear cristallo, minor imperfections visible
      to a trained eye but functional. He keeps it in a leather pouch
      at his belt.
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "Enzo's belt pouch"
    significance: "Enzo's talisman; represents his identity as a craftsman. He holds it up to the light when thinking. It also functions practically — he uses it to examine fine details."

  - name: "The Kiddush Cup"
    description: >
      A silver kiddush cup used for Shabbat blessings in the Sforno
      household. Simple but well-made, with a Hebrew inscription around
      the rim. It was a wedding gift to Giacomo and Mirela.
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "the Sforno house"
    significance: "symbol of the Sforno family's Jewish identity and continuity; appears in Shabbat scenes"

  - name: "Serena's Glass Bead Necklace"
    description: >
      A necklace of small, multicolored glass beads — each one made by
      Serena's father, Maestro Contarini, as a demonstration of his skill.
      Red, blue, green, amber, each perfectly round and smooth.
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "worn by Serena"
    significance: "represents Serena's connection to the glass world; a gift from father to daughter that parallels Enzo's inheritance from Giacomo"

  - name: "The Yellow Rotella"
    description: >
      The yellow circle of saffron-dyed fabric, roughly palm-sized, that
      Enzo is required to wear sewn onto his doublet to identify him
      as Jewish. It is always present, always visible, always marking him.
    location_tracking:
      - period: "entire novel"
        location: "sewn onto Enzo's outer garment"
    significance: >
      The most important recurring object-symbol in the novel. It represents
      Enzo's otherness, his vulnerability, and the constant negotiation
      between belonging and exclusion. Every time another character's eyes
      drop to it, the reader feels what Enzo feels.
