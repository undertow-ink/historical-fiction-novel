The grinding compound had gone cold overnight, a paste of emery and water settled into a grey crust at the bottom of the copper bowl. Enzo scraped it with a wooden spatula, working the mixture back to life the way a baker works a sluggish dough — pressing, folding, pressing again until the grit caught and held. The furnace breathed behind him. Low, banked, its voice reduced to a murmur that vibrated through the brick floor and up through the soles of his feet. It never stopped. In six years he had never known it to stop, not even the night his father died, not even then.

He set the bowl aside and laid his tools in order along the bench. Lead lap, scarred and heavy, centered on the spindle. The rag for wiping. Three grades of compound in their clay pots — coarse emery, fine tripoli, red rouge for the final polish. Water vessel, half full, a skin of dust on its surface. He filled it from the barrel by the door, carrying it with both hands because the handle had cracked last week and he had not yet carved a new one. The morning air off the lagoon came through the open door with him, salt and cool, cutting the furnace smell of hot metal and old ash.

Dawn was still new. Through the high windows, light entered the workshop in pale shafts that caught the dust and made it visible — thousands of motes turning in slow procession, like ground glass suspended in air. The furnace's bocche glowed a dull orange at their rims, banked fire visible only as a color, not yet as heat. By midday the workshop would be brutal, the air thick enough to chew. For now it belonged to him.

This was his time. Before the garzoni arrived with their noise and elbowing, before Tomaso came in smelling of last night's wine, before the furnace was stoked to its full white roar and the maestro began calling orders. Enzo worked best in silence. His father had been the same — Giacomo Sforno, who could hold a gather of molten glass on the end of a blowpipe with hands so steady they looked carved, who had taught Enzo to read light the way other men read faces. Eight months dead, and Enzo still turned sometimes at a sound expecting to see him standing at the bocca, his silhouette halved by the glow.

He took the first lens blank from the rack. A disc of cristallo the width of his palm, rough-cut and cloudy, its edges still sharp from the wheel. He held it up to the morning light and turned it. Slowly. The way his father had taught him. Light passed through the glass and bent, scattering in a pale circle on the brick wall opposite. He turned it a quarter more. The circle compressed, sharpened, dimmed. There — a flaw. A thread of opacity, fine as a hair, running from the center toward the lower edge. An air bubble drawn long during the cooling, trapped now in the body of the glass like a vein in marble.

He set it aside. Flawed. The cristallo had come from the last melt before Lent, when the furnace ran hot and the garzoni were careless with the fritting. Three of the twelve blanks from that batch had shown similar threads. Bardolino had said nothing about it, which meant he had noticed and chosen to hold his tongue, which meant the raw silica was not what it should be.

The second blank was clean. He held it up, turned it, watched the light pass through without interruption. Good glass spoke to you this way — not with words but with behavior, the way it bent light, the way it sat in the hand, a certain weight that meant the density was even throughout. He set it on the lap and began to grind.

The rhythm took him. Short strokes at first, the blank pressed flat against the spinning lead disc, compound hissing between the surfaces. He bore down with the heel of his right hand and guided with his left, fingertips sensing the vibration through the glass. When the grit caught on an irregularity he felt it — a stutter, a resistance, like a rough place on a planed board. He adjusted pressure, shifted angle. The stutter smoothed.

Grit worked into the creases of his fingers and lodged beneath his nails, white powder over the old calluses. His hands looked old for seventeen. Scarred, roughened, the left wrist carrying a burn mark from the year he turned twelve, when a pontil rod had slipped and pressed its orange tip against his skin for the space of a breath. He did not mind the mark. It was legible. It said something true about him.

He had finished the first pass on three blanks when the door opened.

Bardolino. Too early. The maestro did not come to the furnace before the bells of San Donato rang prime, and the sky through the windows was still more grey than blue. Yet here he was, filling the doorframe the way he always did, broad shoulders and that slight rightward lean from the bad leg. He wore his good doublet, the dark green one, which was wrong for a workshop morning. His grey hair was uncombed.

"Maestro," Enzo said. He did not rise. At the grinding bench, you did not rise. Bardolino had taught him that — the work held precedence over courtesy.

Bardolino closed the door behind him and stood a moment, looking at the furnace the way he sometimes did, as if reading something in the banked glow. The signet ring on his right hand caught the ember-light — the rampant lion, the goblet. He crossed to Enzo's bench without greeting.

"Show me yesterday's work."

Enzo handed him the three finished blanks from the rack, the ones he had ground and polished to final smoothness the afternoon before. Bardolino took them one by one, held each to the light, turned them with those enormous scarred hands. His inspection was slow. Deliberate. He lingered on the second blank, tilting it back and forth, frowning at something Enzo could not see.

"This one is a quarter-point thick on the north edge."

Enzo looked. He had measured that blank twice yesterday with the calipers. It was even. He was certain of it. But he said nothing, because Bardolino was the maestro and certainty in an apprentice was not a virtue to be displayed.

"I will correct it," he said.

"Do." Bardolino set the blank down and rubbed the stump of his missing fingertip against his thumb. Back and forth, back and forth — the gesture he made when his mind was working at something that would not yield. Then he pulled a stool to the end of the bench and sat, which was unusual enough that Enzo's hands went still on the lap.

That was when Enzo saw the ink.

Dark stains on Bardolino's right hand, between the second and third fingers, along the edge of the palm. Fresh enough to be wet-looking in the creases. Ink, not soot, not glass residue — Enzo knew every stain this work could leave, and ink was not among them. Bardolino's hands were made for pontil rods and jacks and shears. Not for quills.

"I have taken a commission," Bardolino said. His voice was hoarse, more than usual. The deep rasp that came from thirty years of breathing furnace air sounded frayed at its edges. "From the Morosini family. A cristallo mirror for a wedding gift. The bride is a Contarini — you understand what that means."

Enzo understood. Two patrician houses joined. The gift would need to be extraordinary. A mirror of true cristallo, flat and clear, its surface ground to such evenness that the reflection held no distortion — a face given back whole. The grinding alone would take weeks.

"The mirror blank I will blow myself," Bardolino said. "The annealing must be perfect. The grinding and polishing — the precision work — I am giving to you."

Not to Tomaso. The name was not spoken, but it pressed against the air between them like heat from an opened bocca. Tomaso, Bardolino's own son, three years older than Enzo, who had been grinding lenses since before Enzo arrived at this furnace, whose hands were capable if not gifted, whose pride ran as hot as the glass he shaped. Tomaso, who already watched Enzo the way a dog watches a second dog brought into the house.

"The Morosini steward will expect perfection," Bardolino said. "A flaw they can see is an insult. A flaw they can feel is a disaster. Can you do this?"

Enzo's thumb found his left fingertips and rubbed across the roughened skin. He could feel the dried grit there, fine as salt. The yellow circle sewn on his doublet pulled at the wool as he straightened — a small weight, always present, the way the furnace hum was always present. He thought of Tomaso's face when he learned. The silence that would come first, then the heat.

He could say no. He could tell Bardolino that Tomaso had more experience, that the commission should go to a senior grinder, that keeping peace in the workshop was worth more than any single mirror. He could say these things and they would be reasonable and Bardolino would hear them and perhaps even agree.

But the blank on the bench caught the growing light, and in its clouded surface Enzo saw what it could become — clear, true, giving back the world without distortion. That was what he wanted. Not the commission, not the honor. The work itself. The chance to grind a surface so perfect that light passed through it as though the glass were not there.

"I can do this," he said.

Bardolino looked at him. Those pale grey-blue eyes, watery and reddened at the rims from years of staring into the fire, searched his face for something. Whatever the maestro found or failed to find, he nodded once and stood.

"Good. I will tell Tomaso." He said it flatly, the way a man states the weather. He turned toward the furnace and stood before the central bocca, staring into the banked coals. The ink stains on his hand were visible even in the dim light — dark against the map of old burns and calluses. He reached into his pocket and turned something there. The millefiori piece, Enzo knew. The little disc of fused colored glass that Bardolino kept the way some men kept rosary beads.

Whatever had driven the maestro to his writing desk before dawn, whatever name he had put on paper and sealed with wax, it had left him somewhere else. His body stood in the workshop. His thoughts were in a country Enzo could not enter.

The furnace murmured. Outside, the bells of San Donato began to ring prime, and with them came the distant clatter of boats along the fondamenta, the first shouts of the morning. The garzoni would arrive soon. Tomaso would arrive soon.

Enzo turned back to his bench. He picked up the blank Bardolino had called thick and held it to the light one more time. Turned it. The light passed through even and clean, no thickening at the edge, no distortion. The measurement had been correct.

He set it on the lap and reached for the compound. If Bardolino wanted it thinner, he would grind it thinner. He would grind it so thin that light would forget the glass was there. He bore down, and the lead disc spun, and the grit sang its high thin note between the surfaces, and the morning opened around him like a door.
