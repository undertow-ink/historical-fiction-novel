The first of them came with the bells still ringing.

Enzo heard the door before he saw it open — the scrape of swollen wood against stone, then daylight cutting across the floor in a bright wedge that died before it reached the furnace. Piero entered first, as he always did, his leather apron already tied, his tools in a canvas roll under one arm. He was the eldest of the serventi, fifty or more, with a face like something fired too long in a kiln. He did not greet Enzo. He never did. He crossed to his station beside the central bocca, set down his tools, and began to unwrap them with the slow care of a man handling relics.

Behind him came the others. Two garzoni whose names Enzo still confused — both young, both from the same parish on the northern end of the island, both with the red wind-chapped hands of boys who had spent their childhoods hauling nets. They went straight to the woodpile and began feeding the furnace, birch splits first, then the heavier oak that would hold the heat through the day's work. The fire answered. It always answered. The banked murmur of the night fire thickened into something with a voice, a rising drone that climbed the walls and pressed against the ceiling beams and settled into the bones of the floor.

More men arrived. The workshop filled the way a vessel fills — not all at once but in a steady pour, each body adding volume and pressure and heat. Serventi took their places at the marver stones and the pontil racks. Garzoni hauled sand and soda ash from the storeroom, swept the blowing floor, laid out the shaping tools in their prescribed order. Each man knew his station. Each station had been earned through years of proximity to the fire, moving closer as skill permitted, the hierarchy written in the geography of the room. The maestro stood nearest the central bocca. The serventi flanked him. The garzoni worked the edges. And Enzo, at his grinding bench against the far wall, occupied a position that belonged to no rank at all — essential and peripheral, like a finger on a hand that no one thinks to name.

Bardolino stood where Enzo had last seen him, before the open mouth of the furnace. He had not moved. The fire had risen around him like a tide, and he stood in it, turning the millefiori disc between his thumb and forefinger, watching the garzoni work the fuel. His good doublet was wrong for the heat. The velvet would be ruined by noon. He did not appear to notice, or to care.

The furnace reached full draw. The sound changed. What had been a murmur became a roar, and what had been a roar became something beyond sound — a pressure, a living thing that swallowed speech and forced men to shout or use their hands. The central bocca glowed orange-white, a color that had no name in any language Enzo knew but that every glassmaker recognized: the color of cristallo ready to gather, the color the workers called the mouth of the beast. Heat rolled off the bocca in waves visible to the naked eye, bending the air so that the men on the far side of the furnace rippled and warped like reflections in bad glass.

Enzo kept his head down. The compound hissed beneath the spinning lap, and the lens took shape by subtraction — each pass removing a layer finer than the skin on milk. This was the work. This was the world reduced to two surfaces and the grit between them.

He did not look up when Tomaso arrived.

He heard it, though. The door again, and then a voice cutting through the furnace noise — loud, proprietary, the voice of a man entering a room he considers his. Tomaso greeted Piero by name, clapped one of the garzoni on the shoulder hard enough to stagger him, and laughed at something no one else had said. He was tall, taller than his father, with sandy hair he wore longer than fashion required and a jaw that led him into rooms like the prow of a boat.

"The fire looks good," Tomaso said to no one and everyone. He stripped off his cloak and hung it on the peg nearest the door — the peg that had been Bardolino's before Tomaso claimed it and Bardolino let him. He crossed to the marver and ran his fingers along the polished marble surface, checking for grit or debris, performing the inspection that was his father's to perform.

Bardolino did not turn.

Word moved through the workshop the way heat moved through glass — fast, invisible, transforming what it touched. Enzo did not hear who said it first. One of the garzoni, perhaps, who had overheard Bardolino speaking that morning, or Piero, who heard everything and forgot nothing. By the time the furnace reached its full voice, every man in the room knew about the Morosini commission. A cristallo mirror. Wedding gift. Patrician money. The kind of work that put a furnace's name in mouths across the lagoon.

Enzo felt the knowledge arrive at his back the way he felt a change in the fire's intensity — not through any single sensation but through a shift in the quality of attention around him. Glances he was not supposed to see. A murmur beneath the roar.

Old Piero was the one who said it. He was talking to the garzone beside him, not troubling to lower his voice, the way men do not trouble to lower their voices around dogs or children or people they do not consider fully present.

"The Jew boy gets the mirror work." He said it with his back to Enzo, loading a pontil with gathered glass. A statement of fact. The same tone a man might use to observe that the wind had shifted. "The Sforno boy. Grinding."

The garzone said nothing. Piero shrugged and turned the pontil, and the glass on its tip glowed like a small captured sun, and the conversation was over, if it could be called a conversation at all.

Tomaso was six paces away. He had heard. Enzo knew he had heard because his hands stopped moving on the marver stone for one breath, then two, then resumed. He did not correct Piero. He did not speak. The silence was a door he chose not to open, and by choosing, he opened a different one.

The morning wore on. Enzo ground the lens. The compound dried and he mixed more, measuring the Armenian bole by eye, adding water from the clay jug beneath his bench until the consistency was right — thick enough to cut, thin enough to flow. His hands knew this. His hands had known this since his father first closed them around a grinding tool on a morning so distant it had become more image than memory: a man's brown fingers over a boy's small ones, the smell of pumice, a voice saying *slow, slow, let the grit do the work*.

Tomaso came to him before the first blow of the day. He stopped at the edge of Enzo's station, close enough that his shadow fell across the lap. Enzo did not look up. He felt the shadow and kept grinding.

"My father tells me you have the Morosini piece," Tomaso said. His voice was controlled. Almost pleasant. "The precision work."

"He did." Enzo kept his hands moving.

"That is family work, Sforno. That mirror carries our name."

"Your father assigned it."

"My father makes many decisions." Tomaso stepped closer. His boot touched the leg of Enzo's bench, and the vibration traveled through the wood and into Enzo's hands, a faint disturbance in the rhythm of the lap. "Not all of them are understood by people outside the family."

The word sat between them. *Outside*. It meant what Piero's words had meant, but it was cleaner, shaped with more craft, the way a pontil shapes raw glass into something that can be held up to the light and admired for its form.

"Tomaso." Bardolino's voice came from behind them both, and it came wrong. Too loud. Too sharp. The maestro had turned from the furnace, and his face in the orange light was a mask of something far larger than his son's jealousy — a fury compressed into a single word that cracked through the workshop noise and silenced the nearest garzoni mid-motion. "Enough."

Tomaso blinked. His mouth opened and closed. He had expected resistance but not this, not the full weight of his father's authority brought down like a hammer on a thing that required only a finger's pressure. Something was wrong with the proportion. The anger did not fit its occasion, the way a lens ground to the wrong curve will magnify beyond what the eye can hold.

"I was only — " Tomaso said.

"I said enough." Bardolino held his son's gaze for three full seconds. Enzo counted them by the pulse in his own wrist. Then the maestro turned back to the furnace and placed both hands on the rim of the marver, gripping the stone as if he needed it to stand. The millefiori disc was nowhere visible. He had put it away.

Tomaso left without looking at Enzo. His boots struck the floor hard on each step, carrying the argument his voice could not finish.

The workshop rearranged itself around the silence the way water rearranges itself around a stone. Men resumed their work. The furnace roared. The garzoni fed the fire.

At the next bench, Marco Dolfin set a cup of water beside Enzo's elbow. He did it without speaking, without pausing in his own work, the gesture so small and practiced it could have been an accident — a cup set down on the nearest flat surface by a man whose hands were full. But the cup was placed precisely where Enzo could reach it, and the water was cool, and Marco's eyes met his for a single beat before they moved away.

Enzo drank. The water was cold against the heat that filled the workshop like a second atmosphere, and he held it in his mouth for a moment before swallowing.

He set the cup down and picked up the grinding tool. The compound sang. The lap turned. The lens beneath his hands grew thinner by degrees no eye could measure but his fingers could feel — the difference between a surface that resisted light and one that let it pass, between a thing that was almost right and a thing that was true. Outside his small circle of grit and glass and spinning lead, the furnace mouth blazed and the men of the Bardolino workshop moved through their stations in the ancient choreography of fire, and the morning's heat climbed toward a noon that would be indistinguishable from any other noon on any other day in the long history of the island, which was exactly what Enzo needed it to be.
