The oar entered the water without sound.

Enzo sat low in the sandolo's stern, his knees drawn up, the grinding case between his feet. Ahead the boatman worked the single oar in its forcola, each stroke a slow pivot that sent the flat hull forward over water the color of spent lead. Murano fell behind. Its chimney smoke still marked the sky — a dozen columns, each a different shade of grey depending on what the furnace ate that hour, wood or charcoal or the pine resin Bardolino preferred for his hottest burns. The smoke leaned south. The air over the lagoon was cooler than the air over land, and it carried salt and the sweet rot of weed exposed on mudflats where the tide had pulled back to show the bones of the shallow world beneath.

He watched the water. It moved in no direction he could name, a slow confusion of currents that the sandolo rode without effort, the hull drawing less than a hand's breadth. A barge passed to the north, heavy with something covered in canvas, riding so low that the lagoon lapped its gunwales. Two men stood at its bow arguing about rope. Beyond them a pair of fishing boats worked the channel markers, their nets strung between poles that tilted at angles no geometry would sanction, and a gondola cut south toward Torcello with a lantern already lit at its prow though the sun had not fully gone.

The light was the color of a gather cooling on the pipe — that moment when the molten glass lost its fire and took on the dull glow of something caught between states, no longer liquid, not yet solid. Enzo knew that color. He had watched it ten thousand times in the Bardolino furnace, and every evening crossing the lagoon he saw it again spread across the whole of the sky, and every evening it made him think of his father, who had loved this hour and called it the glassmaker's twilight, the time when the world showed its true temperature.

His father had been dead eight months.

The boatman coughed and spat into the water. He was an old man from Burano whose name Enzo had never learned despite a hundred crossings. They did not speak. The arrangement was a soldo each way and silence, which suited them both.

Venice rose ahead. At this distance it was a dark line drawn across the eastern horizon, interrupted by the campanili of a dozen churches and the taller shape of San Marco's tower, which caught the last of the light on its brick face and held it. The city looked flat from the water, improbable, as though someone had laid a lens of stone and wood across the surface of the lagoon and forgotten to give it depth. Only as you drew closer did the buildings separate, did the canals open like cracks in a fired glaze, did the mass resolve into a thousand particular things — a window, a mooring post, a woman shaking a cloth from a balcony.

A supply boat crossed their path, close enough that Enzo could hear the voices of the men aboard. Two of them sat on crates near the bow. Merchants, by their dress — good wool, no patches, hats with brims that had been shaped by someone who owned a block.

"Milan will not hold them," one said. He had a voice trained to carry across a warehouse. "Ludovico has no army worth the name. He invited the French in and now he cannot show them out."

"Charles wants Naples, not Milan."

"Charles wants whatever his troops can reach. They are past Lyon. Twenty thousand, I am told, with Swiss pike and Gascon infantry and artillery that can breach any wall in Italy."

"Rumors."

"My brother-in-law trades in Chambéry. He has seen the column with his own eyes."

The supply boat pulled ahead. Their voices thinned, became just the shapes of words without content, and then the water between the two hulls widened and there was only the oar's rhythm and the small lapping of the lagoon against the sandolo's strakes. Enzo let the conversation go. French troops. A king whose name he recognized from talk in the Rialto markets but whose ambitions had nothing to do with lenses or grinding compound or the Morosini commission that would keep him fed through the summer. Wars were for men who owned things worth defending.

The patrol boat came out of the channel between San Michele and the mainland, moving fast. Four oarsmen and a man standing in the stern wearing the short cloak of the Signori di Notte's service. They cut across the sandolo's bow with a competence that left no room for accident, and the standing man raised his hand, palm out.

The boatman shipped his oar.

"Papers," the officer said. He did not raise his voice. He did not need to. The patrol boat came alongside and one of the oarsmen caught the sandolo's gunwale with a hook. The two hulls knocked together and held.

Enzo reached into his doublet and produced the folded permit — his passage authorization between Murano and Cannaregio, signed by the Ufficiali al Cattaver, valid until the feast of San Giovanni. He held it out. The officer took it without looking at him, unfolded it, read it slowly enough that Enzo understood the reading was itself the exercise, not the content.

"Sforno," the officer said.

"Yes."

The officer's gaze moved from the paper to the yellow circle stitched to Enzo's doublet, the rotella gialla the width of a communion wafer, positioned over the left breast where a Christian might wear a badge of his confraternity or his guild. The cloth was good — his mother had sewn it tight so the edges would not fray — and the dye was the particular shade of saffron that the law required, not gold, not ochre, but the color of a thing meant to be seen.

The officer looked at the circle. He looked at Enzo's face. He refolded the paper and handed it back.

"You are cutting it close," he said. "The bell has not rung but it will soon."

"I know," Enzo said.

There were other things he could have said. That his permit was valid until the final bell. That the sun had not yet set. That he had made this crossing six days in seven for two years and knew the tides and the light and the exact minute when the curfew fell as well as any boatman on the lagoon. He could have said all of this, and the officer would have listened, perhaps, and nodded, perhaps, and then checked the paper again, more slowly this time, and found something to question — a date, a seal, the spelling of a name — because that was how it worked when you wore the circle and spoke above the volume that the circle permitted.

He said none of it. He put the paper back inside his doublet and sat with his hands on his knees and waited while the officer looked at him a moment longer, neither hostile nor kind but merely present, fulfilling a function, and then turned to his oarsmen and said, "Release them."

The hook withdrew. The patrol boat pulled away, its oars churning the pewter water white for three strokes before settling into their rhythm. The boatman unshipped his oar and began again without comment.

Enzo's hands were still on his knees. He pressed them flat against the cloth, the tendons in his wrists drawn tight, and held them there until the pressure became its own kind of answer, a substitute for the words he had not spoken and the expression he had not worn and the posture he had not taken. The Morosini commission. The grinding case between his feet. The compound that sang when the lap turned. These were the things. Everything else was weather.

Venice grew. The buildings gained their depth, their particular faces. The canals opened. Cannaregio's low waterfront emerged from the general mass — the timber yards, the dyers' poles hung with cloth that dripped colored water into the canal, the small stone quay where the boatman would let him off and where he would step onto land and become, in the space of that single step, a different category of person than the one who had spent the day grinding lenses in a furnace on Murano.

The sandolo touched the quay. Enzo picked up his case and climbed out. The stone was slick with weed. He paid the boatman his soldo and stood for a moment on the fondamenta while the flat-bottomed boat pushed off and disappeared into the thickening dark.

The air here smelled of cook-fires and canal water and the particular dampness of stone that never fully dried. Above him the buildings leaned together across the calle like conspirators. A lamp burned in a window on the second floor of a house he passed every day. He walked into the narrows, the grinding case in his right hand, the yellow circle on his chest catching the lamplight each time he passed beneath a window, then falling dark, then catching it again — a pulse, steady and visible, marking his passage through the city that employed him and contained him and would never, for all its beauty, let him forget the terms.
