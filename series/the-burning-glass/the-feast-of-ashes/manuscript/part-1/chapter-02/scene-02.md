The staircase smelled of fish frying in oil.

He climbed in the dark, one hand on the wall where the plaster had worn smooth from years of palms doing the same. The grinding case knocked against his shin at each step. On the landing he touched the mezuzah on the doorpost, brought his fingers to his lips, and pushed the door open.

Mirela stood at the brazier with her back to him. She was turning fish in a shallow pan, the oil spitting and popping, and she did not turn around but said, "You are late."

"The patrol."

She nodded. The fish hissed. She lifted a piece with a wooden fork and set it on a clay plate lined with cloth to drain. The room was warm and close, the ceiling beams hung with bundles of dried rosemary and thyme that stirred in the heat rising from the brazier. On the table she had laid the white linen cloth, the one she washed on Thursdays and pressed with the flat iron so that on Friday evenings the stains and threadbare patches were harder to see. The challah sat at the center, covered with its own small cloth, two braided loaves that she had baked that afternoon. The kiddush cup stood beside them, filled already with the dark sweet wine from the mainland that cost four soldi a bottle and tasted of raisins and something faintly metallic, like the water in a canal after rain.

Two places set. And the third.

The third place had its plate and its cup and its square of bread, arranged with the same care as the others, positioned at the end of the table nearest the wall where Giacomo's workbench stood. If anyone asked — no one asked — Mirela would say it was for Elijah, the wandering prophet, the guest who might come any Shabbat to announce the redemption. She said this with a steady voice and a level gaze and the absolute conviction of a woman who knew exactly what she was doing and for whom.

Enzo set the grinding case on the floor beside the door. He unfastened his doublet and pulled it off, then folded it so the yellow circle was hidden inside the cloth, against itself, and placed it on the chest by the window. Beneath it he wore a linen shirt, sweat-damp at the collar. In this room, on this evening, there was no badge. There was no category. There was a son standing in his mother's kitchen while the candles waited to be lit.

"Sit," Mirela said. "Eat when it is ready."

He sat on the stool nearest the window. Through the cracked shutters the calle was darkening. A woman's voice came from the floor above, speaking rapidly to a child. The canal lapped against the foundation stones. He could hear it always, that sound, like a tongue against a lip, patient and ceaseless.

"I have news," he said.

Mirela turned from the brazier. Her face was lit on one side by the coals, the other side in shadow, and the kerchief she wore low on her forehead made the line between light and dark sharper than it was. Her hands were red. They were always red, cracked across the knuckles from the lye and the cold water and the hours of wringing other people's linen.

"What news?"

"Bardolino gave me the Morosini commission. A cristallo mirror for a patrician wedding."

She was still for a moment. Then she wiped her hands on her apron and came to the table and stood across from him, her fingers resting on the back of the empty stool.

"A mirror," she said. "For Morosini."

"For his daughter's marriage. The grinding alone is three weeks' work. He chose me over Tomaso."

Something moved in her face, fast, a tightening around the eyes that could have been pride or fear or both at once. She pulled out the stool and sat.

"And Tomaso? What did Tomaso say?"

"What you would expect."

"Then you should expect what follows." She said it quietly. "The nail that stands above the wood is the one the hammer finds."

"I am careful."

"Your father was careful." The words came out before she could catch them. She looked down at her hands on the table, the reddened fingers laced together. When she spoke again her voice had dropped. "I saw Rabbi Yehudah today, at the well. He says there is talk in the Consiglio about new restrictions. Where we may live. Where we may walk. What hours."

"There is always talk."

"This is not always. He said the word ghetto."

The room was quiet. The oil in the pan had stopped spitting. A draft came through the shutters and the dried herbs overhead turned slowly on their strings.

"They will not," Enzo said.

"Perhaps." She rose and went back to the brazier and moved the pan off the heat. "Perhaps not. But a boy with a yellow circle who grinds mirrors for patricians — such a boy is seen. And what is seen can be envied. And what is envied—" She stopped herself. She took down two clay bowls from the shelf — the meat dishes, the ones with the chip on the rim that marked them — and began ladling bean soup.

His gaze went to the workbench. He did not mean it to go there. It went the way water goes to the lowest point in a floor, without decision, without anything that could be called will. The tools lay where Giacomo had left them eight months ago. The grinding forms, half a dozen of them, concave and convex, their surfaces still carrying the marks of his father's hand. The small lathe with its leather strap. The calipers, open to the last measurement his father had taken, a width of glass that no longer existed, set to a number that referred to nothing, holding an absence the width of two brass fingers.

Dust on everything. Fine and pale. The dust of a room that was lived in around an object that was not.

Mirela set the bowls on the table. She had seen him looking. He knew because she placed his bowl in front of him with both hands instead of one, a gesture that carried something in it, and then she touched his shoulder as she passed behind him to her stool, her chapped fingers resting there for the space of a breath before lifting away.

He almost asked. The question sat behind his teeth the way it always sat there, a hard smooth shape he could feel with his tongue. The night before the explosion. Where she had gone after the evening meal. Why she had come home with her shawl wet and her face like a woman who had looked through a window and seen what was coming. Eight months of not asking. Not because he did not want to know. Because every time he looked at her hands, her red and ruined hands that washed strangers' sheets so he could grind lenses on Murano, he understood that some questions were a kind of violence, and that she had the right to her silences, even the ones that cut him.

He did not ask.

Mirela rose. She went to the table where the two candles stood in their brass holders, the ones her mother had brought from Padua, dented and dark with tarnish but polished for Friday nights until they gave back the light. She struck the flint. The wick caught. She lit the second candle from the first, then drew her hands over the flames three times, pulling the light toward her face, and covered her eyes.

Her lips moved. The blessing was nearly silent, a whisper that belonged to the room and the flames and the space between her palms and her closed eyes. Enzo watched the candlelight climb the wall behind her, two small fires reflected in the kiddush cup's dull silver, in the glaze of the challah cloth, in the window glass where the last of the daylight was fading.

She lowered her hands. Her eyes were bright and wet. She said, "Shabbat shalom."

"Shabbat shalom," Enzo said.

The room held its warmth. Outside, the canal moved in its ancient channel, and the calle darkened, and somewhere a bell was ringing the hour. But here the candles burned. The bread waited beneath its cloth. The third place was set, the cup filled, the chair empty, and the light fell on all of it equally — on what was present and what was gone, on the table and the workbench, on the living and the dead — and for the span of that light's reach, the room was enough.
