The crack in the ceiling began above the door and ran to the corner where the walls met, branching twice, thinning as it went. He had traced it so many times that he could see it with his eyes closed — and did now, the dark behind his lids no different from the dark of the room, the crack's path as familiar as the walk from the fondamenta to the bridge. A map of nothing. A vein in dead plaster.

Mirela's breathing had steadied. She slept on her side, turned toward the wall, one hand curled beneath her jaw the way she always slept, as though holding a question she would not ask until morning. The candles had burned to their brass, guttered, gone. The room smelled of tallow and the last breath of challah and, beneath both, the water that was always there, the lagoon pressing its cold mouth against the foundation stones.

He should sleep. His body knew this. His shoulders ached from the grinding wheel, and his right hand, the one that held the lens against the form, had stiffened into a claw he had to flex and flex to open. Tomorrow was Shabbat. No work. Rest. He should sleep.

The crack forked above the door.

His father had taught him on a Tuesday. He remembered because the market boats had been thick in the canal that morning, their hulls knocking against the posts, and Giacomo had said, without looking up from the wheel, that the world was louder on Tuesdays, and that loud days were good days for careful work because the noise made you pay closer attention to the thing beneath your hands.

Enzo had been eleven. The workshop then was a rented room near San Marcuola, smaller than this sleeping chamber, with one window that faced east and caught the morning in a narrow blade across the floor. Giacomo had set a rough-cut lens on the bench — a convex disc, thick at the center, cloudy with grinding marks — and placed Enzo's fingers on its rim.

"Hold it to the light."

Enzo held it up. The window's blade came through the glass and broke apart on the far wall into a smear of brightness, edges swimming.

"Now turn it."

He turned the lens. The smear moved, gathered, tightened. Giacomo's hand came over his, adjusted the angle — his father's fingers calloused and dusted with pumice, the smell of him iron filings and sweat and the lanolin he rubbed into his knuckles to keep the skin from splitting. Together they tilted the lens until the smear on the wall contracted to a point, a circle of light no bigger than a soldo, fierce and still.

"You see?"

Enzo saw.

"The glass doesn't create the light, Enzo." Giacomo took his hand away. The point held. "It only decides where the light falls."

The room on the canal in the dark. The crack in the ceiling. Mirela breathing. And that — that bright still point on a far wall in a workshop that no longer existed, held by hands that no longer existed, explained by a voice that had stopped.

He pressed his thumb against the roughened pads of his fingers. Pumice and glass did that to skin, wore the whorls smooth, left a surface that could feel the width of a scratch invisible to the eye. His father's hands had been the same. Worse. The prints nearly gone, the fingertips like polished stone.

He had not been in the furnace room. He had been outside, on the fondamenta, thirty steps away, carrying a crate of cullet for the morning melt. The sound came first. Not loud. Too large for loud. A compression, a swallowing of air, as though the building had inhaled and held it and then the walls gave back what they could not contain. Glass. He remembered glass — not the sound of it breaking but the sight of it afterward, a skin of it over everything, over the stones, over the water, over his arms where it had fallen like rain that meant to cut.

Smoke. Smoke that was the wrong color, dark at the base and yellowish-white where it met the sky, and the smell — not wood, not coal, something underneath those, something that was not fuel, that was what fuel does to a body when there is nowhere for the body to go.

He did not remember running. He was outside and then he was inside and there was no in-between, no door, no threshold, just the furnace room opened like a split fruit, the crucible in pieces, the stones black and wet, and on the floor near the annealing oven, a shape.

His hands were shaking now. He flattened them against the straw of the pallet. Pressed until the weave bit into his palms.

Giacomo had not slept for three nights before it happened. Enzo knew this because he had heard him in the dark — not this dark, the dark of the old room — pacing, stopping, pacing. And on the fourth day, the day before, Giacomo had come home from the furnace early, before the evening bell, which he never did. Mirela had said something Enzo could not hear. His father had answered with his back turned, his voice flattened to a line, and his hands — his hands on the doorframe, gripping the wood, the tendons drawn tight as cords.

Then the next morning. Then the furnace. Then the sound that was too large.

The ceiling crack branched above him in the dark. He traced it with his eyes closed. Fork, thin, fork, thinner, gone.

What had Giacomo known? What had changed in those last days, what had entered the space between his father and the furnace and turned a man who steadied his son's hand over a lens into a man who gripped a doorframe as though the floor might tilt and drop him through?

The straw pressed against his back. The canal spoke its idiot syllable against the stones. Mirela's breathing, slow and even, a rhythm that asked nothing.

He let the question go. He made himself let it go the way he made his cramped hand open — deliberately, finger by finger, until the fist was flat and the ache was only an ache and not a shape that held something.

Sleep came. Thin. Shallow as canal water at low tide.

But the question lay beneath it, and it did not close its eyes.
