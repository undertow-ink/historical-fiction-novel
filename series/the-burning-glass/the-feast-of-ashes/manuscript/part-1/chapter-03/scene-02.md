The smoke tasted different walking back. Or he tasted it differently — the same char and alkali haze that hung over the Fondamenta every working morning, but now it reached him through a scrim of warmth that had nothing to do with the furnaces. Serena's voice was still in his ears, the dry precision of it, the way she had said *that's worth three days* as if the flaw in his cristallo were not a failure but a map to the next attempt. He rubbed his thumb across his fingertips and felt the ghost of the grinding wheel there, the familiar rasp of callus on callus.

The canal was busy now. Two barges had wedged themselves abreast where the waterway narrowed past the Ballarin workshop, and a gondolier was cursing them from behind with the fluency of a man who had rehearsed this particular anger many times. Enzo walked with the sun on his left shoulder and the water throwing white splintered shapes against the brick walls of the fondamenta. He should hurry. Tomaso would note the time of his return and store it somewhere behind those small accounting eyes, and Bardolino would hear about it before the afternoon pour.

He walked faster.

The Bardolino furnace came into view around the last turning of the fondamenta — the familiar shape of it, the soot-dark brick, the chimney trailing its perpetual flag of gray. But at the dock, where normally only the supply barges tied up, a gondola sat on the water with the stillness of something that intended to wait.

Not a working boat. The hull was black and clean, freshly tarred, with none of the scrapes and salt crust that marked the hire boats. The ferro at the prow had six prongs, polished to a brightness that caught the April light and sent it back in clean lines. A private gondola. The cushion on the passenger seat was dark velvet, and the felze — the little cabin — was closed. The gondolier stood at the stern, arms folded, looking at nothing. He wore a livery Enzo did not recognize: dark green, no visible insignia.

Private gondolas did not come to furnace docks. Patricians who commissioned glass sent servants. Merchants came by foot or by hire boat. A private gondola at Bardolino's dock was like a silk glove on a workbench — it drew the eye because it did not belong, the way an inclusion draws the eye in a finished lens, not by what it is but by what it interrupts.

Enzo slowed. He was still thirty paces from the dock, on the canal-side path that ran along the water, and from this angle he could see both the gondola and the back of the furnace — the storeroom side, the secondary entrance that led away from the main workshop. A man was stepping off the gondola onto the dock.

The man moved the way water moves over a flat stone — smoothly, without effort, without calling attention to the movement itself. He was dressed in dark silk, a doublet cut close to the body, and a short cloak that hung without the stiffness of new fabric. Not a craftsman. Not the bright display of a patrician either, none of the brocade or fur trim that men like Morosini wore to signal their station. This was the dress of someone who could afford silk but chose the quietest version of it. His hair was covered by a close black cap. His face — Enzo could not make out the face at this distance, only the angle of the jaw, the clean line of a man who had shaved recently and well.

He carried a leather case. Flat, rectangular, the size of a large folio. He carried it close to his body, tucked under his left arm, the way a man carries something he does not want to set down.

Enzo kept walking. There was no reason to stop. A visitor at the dock, a man with business at the furnace — none of this required his attention. He was an apprentice returning from an errand, nothing more, and the distance between himself and the stranger was the distance between a boy's concerns and a man's private dealings.

But his eye worked on its own. His eye was trained. Four years at the grinding wheel had taught it to notice what did not fit, to register the flaw before the mind caught up, the way a hand feels the scratch in glass before the eye can see it. And what his eye caught now, as the man in dark silk crossed the dock toward the back of the furnace, was the door.

The storeroom door. He knew it well. Every apprentice knew it, though none were permitted to enter — Bardolino kept the storeroom for materials and records, locked always, the key on his own belt. The door was old, dark oak planks gone almost black with years of furnace soot and canal damp, and it had always worn a heavy iron padlock, pitted with rust, as much a part of the door as the hinges.

The padlock was new.

Brass. Bright as a fresh ducat against the dark wood. The metal caught the light the way iron never did — clean, almost liquid in its sheen, throwing back a warm gold where the old lock had been a dead black absence. Enzo's step faltered for half a stride. His eye had found it the way it found an inclusion: involuntarily, because the thing that does not belong announces itself to a trained surface the way a bell announces itself to silence. New brass on old wood. A lock that had been there for as long as Enzo had worked the furnace, replaced — and replaced recently, because the brass had not yet begun to take on the green film that salt air gave to copper alloys within weeks.

The man in dark silk reached the door. It opened before he knocked. Bardolino stood in the gap — Enzo saw him for a half second, the broad shape of him, the leather apron, the hand on the doorframe. Then the man stepped inside, and Bardolino stepped back, and the bright brass lock swung on its hasp as the door closed.

The gondolier had not moved. He stood at the stern of his boat and looked at the canal with the practiced disinterest of a man paid to wait and forget.

Enzo passed the dock. He did not slow. He did not turn his head more than a man might turn it walking along a fondamenta on a morning when the light happened to fall in interesting ways. He kept his pace even and his eyes forward and walked to the main entrance of the Bardolino furnace, where the double doors stood open and the heat reached out to meet him like a hand.

Inside, the workshop was its ordinary self. Piero was at the bench, working a gather on the end of a blowpipe, his face orange in the furnace light and his cheeks puffed with the breath he was about to give. Marco Dolfin sat on the stone ledge near the annealing oven, eating an apple, his big hands making the fruit look like a child's toy. The two serventi moved through their tasks. The furnace sang its low note. Everything was as it should be, and Enzo crossed the floor to his grinding station in the corner where the light from the high window fell in a column of white that turned the stone dust to snow.

He sat. He fitted the cristallo blank into the cradle of the wheel. He began to grind.

The rhythm of it took him — the circular motion of his right hand, the pressure calibrated by feel, the fine grit hissing between the blank and the wheel like sand through a glass timer. His body knew this work and could do it while his mind went elsewhere. This was the danger and the gift of repetitive craft: the hands freed the head, and the head wandered where it pleased.

It wandered to the lock.

New brass. Bright. He had seen Bardolino replace things in the furnace before — a cracked crucible, a warped pontil, a hinge that finally gave. But always with complaint, always with the grudging theatricality of a man who resented every soldo spent on maintenance. A new lock was not nothing. A new lock on the one door Bardolino kept locked, the one room no apprentice entered, replaced quietly, without the usual performance of expense — this was a different kind of change. Not repair. Preparation.

The blank turned under his hands. The grit hissed. He could feel the surface with his fingertips through the faintest variations in resistance, the way a blind man reads a page — here the glass was true, and here it was not, and here the curve was flattening half a degree too soon. He adjusted. The work steadied him, as it always did, pulling his attention down into the small precise world of the wheel, the blank, the slow emergence of a surface that would hold light without breaking it.

But the brass stayed. Behind his concentration, bright and wrong, like a note held too long in a familiar song — not enough to stop the music, but enough to change what the ear expected. He saw it each time he closed his eyes to rest them from the stone dust: the gold gleam against the dark wood, new where nothing had been new for years.

He ground the blank. The morning passed. The lock did not leave him.
