The last of them left at the bell.

Marco first, pulling his cap low, calling something back to Piero about a girl in Cannaregio that Enzo did not catch and did not need to. Then Piero, slower, banking his station, sweeping the cullet into the bin with three practiced strokes. Tomaso had gone an hour before — he always left early now, since the Morosini commission had passed him by, his silence a precise and pointed thing that filled whatever room he occupied. The door scraped shut behind Piero. His footsteps crossed the yard, faded on the fondamenta stones, and were gone.

The furnace had been banked at the end of the blowing day, the fire drawn down to a low red presence behind the iron grate. It would burn through the night — a furnace never fully dies, not if you mean to use it again — but it breathed differently now, a slow tidal pull instead of the day's roar. The bricks ticked as they cooled. The beams above shifted, wood releasing the heat it had held since morning, and the building spoke in the language Enzo knew better than conversation: creak, settle, the faint mineral ping of cooling glass somewhere in the annealing oven. A cup left too close to the edge. He would check it in the morning.

He lit his candle. Carried it to the grinding station in the far corner where the high windows let in what remained of the evening — a thin grey nothing now, April dusk already spent. The candle was better. The candle made the world small: his hands, the wheel, the blank, the brass cradle that held the cristallo steady while he worked. Everything beyond the circle of light ceased to exist, and this was the gift of late work, the reason he stayed when the others left. Not duty. Greed.

The Morosini blank was where he had left it that morning, nested in its cloth. He unwrapped it, held it to the candle. The cristallo caught the flame and broke it into a pale fire along the ground edge — good, clean, the curve developing true. Another two sessions and the first surface would be ready for polishing. He fitted it into the cradle, adjusted the wheel's angle by a quarter turn of the brass screw, and wet the grinding surface with three drops from the stone jar of water he kept at his left hand.

He began to grind.

The sound was the first thing. Not the hiss — that came after, when the grit caught and the blank began to yield — but the low hum of the wheel itself, the stone turning under his foot pedal, a note so constant it became silence. Then the hiss. Then the feel of it, the resistance traveling up through his fingertips where they steadied the blank's edge, a language of pressure and give that told him more than his eyes could about what was happening at the surface where stone met glass.

His breathing slowed to match the wheel. The world contracted to a disc of light and the slow revelation of a curve.

This was the work his father had taught him, and it was the one place where grief could not follow, because grief required a self to feel it and the grinding wheel erased the self. There was only the glass. Only the surface coming true under the abrasive's patient insistence, the way a lagoon fog lifts and the world beneath it is revealed to have been there all along, precise and waiting. He could feel the curve in his fingertips the way a pilot feels the channel — not thinking it, knowing it, the knowledge living in the hand's skin where four years of grit had worn the prints nearly smooth. The blank turned. The grit hissed. The candle flame stood steady in the still air, and Enzo was nowhere and everywhere at once, a consciousness distributed across the surface of a lens, and this was the closest thing he had to prayer.

A sound.

Not the building's settling. Not the furnace. Something behind the storeroom door — fifteen feet to his left, the dark oak with its bright brass lock. A heavy object being moved across a stone floor. The scrape of weight dragged, not dropped. Deliberate.

His foot kept the wheel turning. His hands did not lift from the blank. But his attention — the involuntary attention of the trained eye, the part of him that registered flaws before thought — turned toward the door like a compass needle finding north.

Bardolino was still here.

The dragging stopped. Silence. Then voices — two, both low, both careful. One was Bardolino's, the deep register unmistakable even through oak and brick. The other was lighter, quicker, a voice Enzo did not know. Not Marco, not Piero, not anyone from the furnace. The words would not resolve. They stayed below the threshold of language, a murmur that rose and fell with the cadence of negotiation, or instruction, or the kind of agreement that does not want witnesses.

He ground the blank. The grit hissed. The voices stopped.

The storeroom door opened — he heard the latch, the slight groan of the lower hinge that had needed oil since February — and closed again. Footsteps crossed the workshop floor behind him, and he did not turn. The footsteps reached the far stairs, the ones that led up to Bardolino's quarters above the furnace, and climbed. A door opened and shut above his head. Then nothing.

The workshop held its silence. The furnace breathed. The bricks ticked.

The storeroom door was fifteen feet away. Bardolino was upstairs. The other voice was upstairs, or gone — there might be a second set of stairs from the upper quarters to the canal side, Enzo did not know, had never been above the workshop floor. The storeroom might be unlocked. The brass hasp might be hanging open, the door ready to yield to a hand's pressure, and behind it whatever Bardolino kept that required new brass and dark silk visitors and conversations held below the frequency of apprentice ears.

He did not go. He ground the Morosini blank until the curve matched the template in his hand's memory, until the surface sang the particular note of true, and then he lifted it from the cradle and held it to the candle one final time. Clean. Good. The edge caught the light and threw a small bright line across the far wall, a thread of fire in the dark workshop, and he wrapped the blank in its cloth and set it in the box.

He pinched the candle. Darkness took the room.

He walked to the door by feel and furnace-glow, the faint red pulse from the grate enough to show him the shapes of benches and tools. He passed the storeroom door. Did not stop. Did not touch the handle. But his eye — the eye that would not rest, the eye his father had trained and his father's death had sharpened — caught the lock in the dark. Brass. The faint red light from the furnace grate found its surface the way firelight finds gold, and it gleamed like a thing that had been recently held.

He stepped into the night. The April air off the canal was cool after the furnace's residual warmth, and he pulled his collar close. His sandolo was where he had tied it that morning, rocking gently against the fondamenta stones. He stepped down into it, untied the line, took up the oar.

The lagoon opened before him. Behind, the fires of Murano — Bardolino's, Contarini's, the others — marked the island's edge in dull orange, furnaces that never fully died, breathing through the night like sleeping animals. The water was black and still. Venice waited ahead, a darkness punctuated by the small stars of lanterns along the Fondamente Nove.

He rowed. The oar cut the water. The fires shrank behind him. And in his chest, below the sternum, in the place where the day's heat settled when the work was done, something burned that was not peace and was not fear but sat between them, patient, waiting, a coal he had not chosen to carry and could not yet set down.
