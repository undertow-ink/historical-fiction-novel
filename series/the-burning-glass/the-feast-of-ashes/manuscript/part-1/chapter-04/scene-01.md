The blank was wrong.

Enzo held it to the window light and turned it, slow, the way his father had taught him — a quarter rotation, pause, another quarter, pause — and the flaw presented itself each time at the same meridian. A thread of impurity, no thicker than a hair, running through the cristallo like a vein in marble. It would not grind out. He had known this since yesterday, had hoped the polishing might hide it, but the morning light was merciless and the Morosini commission would not forgive a clouded mirror. Not for a patrician wedding. Not for the price Bardolino had quoted.

He set the blank down on the leather pad and wiped his hands on his apron. Around him the furnace roared its usual conversation — the crackle of the fire, the tap of a pontil against the marver, Tomaso calling for the shears. Normal morning. Normal heat. The light through the high windows fell in long columns of gold across the brick floor, catching the glass dust that hung perpetual in the air, and Enzo watched it for a moment the way he sometimes did, the tiny bright motes turning in their slow paths, each one a splinter of someone's work.

He needed a new blank. The second-grade cristallo he had at his station would not serve. He needed the first-grade stock, the pieces Bardolino kept in the storeroom for commissions that could bear the cost. He had drawn from that stock before, twice, with permission each time and no ceremony — just a nod, the key, and Enzo's own judgment at the rack.

Bardolino stood at the primary bocca, watching one of the younger boys gather a ball of molten glass. His big hands hung at his sides. The furnace light made his face copper and shadow.

"Maestro."

Bardolino did not turn. "What."

"The Morosini blank has a thread. I need to draw a new one from the storeroom."

The boy at the bocca brought the gather out, trailing a thin tail of orange light, and Bardolino watched him carry it to the marver. Only then did he turn. His pale eyes found Enzo. Something moved behind them — not anger, not refusal, but a small quick calculation, the kind a man makes when asked for a thing he cannot reasonably deny.

"A thread," Bardolino said.

"At the fourth meridian. It runs the full diameter. I cannot grind around it."

Bardolino's right hand went to his pocket. Enzo heard the faint click of the millefiori piece turning between thick fingers. The furnace roared. The boy shaped his gather on the stone.

"The blanks are on the second rack," Bardolino said. "Left side, top shelf. Take what you need for the commission." He paused. "The crates along the far wall — don't disturb them. New stock. Not sorted yet."

In six months at this furnace, and two years before that at his father's side in workshops across Murano, no maestro had ever told Enzo which parts of a storeroom to avoid. You went in, you found your material, you came out. A storeroom was a storeroom.

"Yes, Maestro," Enzo said.

Bardolino reached into his doublet and produced the key. Brass, bright, recently cut — it caught the furnace light the way the lock had caught it three nights ago in the dark. The same metal. Enzo took it. The key was warm from Bardolino's body.

"Return it to me when you're done."

Enzo crossed the workshop floor, passing the grinding station, the annealing oven, the wooden racks where the pontils stood like a forest of iron stems. The storeroom door was at the rear, dark oak, heavy. He had passed it a hundred times. But the lock was not the lock he remembered from winter. That had been iron, old, the color of dried blood. This one was brass, and its hasp was bright and unworn, and when he fitted the key and turned it the mechanism opened with the smooth authority of new work.

The door swung in. He stepped through.

The smell stopped him.

It was wrong. The storeroom had always smelled of glass dust and dry straw and the faint mineral scent of cullet stored in open bins. He knew that smell the way he knew the smell of the canal at morning or his mother's kitchen on a Friday evening — it was fixed, constant, part of the architecture. What met him now was different. Brass filings, sharp and metallic, the tang of a locksmith's shop. And under that, linseed oil, heavy and vegetal, the smell of things being preserved against rust or rot. The glass-dust smell was still there but diminished, pushed to the edges of the room like a guest who had been asked to wait.

He stood in the doorway until his eyes adjusted. The single high window let in a bar of pale light that fell across the middle of the room, dividing it. To his left, the familiar racks — shelves of blanks and cullet, boxes of grinding compound, the old ledger Bardolino kept for inventory. To his right, the far wall.

Crates. Six or seven of them, wooden, larger than the blanks boxes, stacked two high and packed with straw that spilled from their edges like pale hair. They had not been there a month ago. They had not been there a week ago. The straw was fresh and yellow, not the grey compressed straw of long storage, and the wood of the crates was clean pine, unweathered, still carrying the faint sweetness of sap.

Enzo turned to the second rack. Found the first-grade blanks on the top shelf where Bardolino had said they would be, wrapped in their linen cloths, each one labeled in the maestro's square hand. He selected two — one for the commission, one for insurance — and set them on the shelf at his elbow. The work was done. He had what he came for.

The crate nearest the window had its lid slightly raised.

He saw it the way he saw flaws in glass — not by looking but by registering, the eye catching what the mind had not yet asked for. The lid sat a finger's width above the lip of the crate, tilted, as though someone had lifted it and set it back without pressing it home. Through the gap, straw. And through the straw, a curve.

Not a goblet's curve. Not the gentle dish of a mirror blank or the rectangular edge of a window pane. This was a full curve, broad, the arc of something larger than his two hands spread flat. He could see only a sliver of it — a crescent of cristallo catching the thin light from the window — but his hands knew glass the way a musician's hands know the neck of a lute, and what they told him from that sliver was wrong. Too large. Too thick. No spectacle lens, no reading stone, no mirror he had ever ground or seen ground required cristallo of that diameter.

He looked at the door. The workshop noise came through it, muffled — the furnace, the voices, the tap of tools. Bardolino was at the bocca. The instruction had been clear.

Enzo lifted the lid.

Straw. He pushed it aside. Beneath it, nested in carved wooden forms, three cristallo lens blanks lay in a row. Each was at least twenty-five centimeters across, ground on one face to a shallow curve, the other face left rough from the mold. The glass was good — first-grade cristallo, clear as spring water, without threads or bubbles that he could see in the dim light. Hours of work in each one. Days, perhaps, given the size of the melt required. Next to them, wrapped in oiled cloth, brass forms — grinding templates, but shaped to curves he did not recognize. Steeper than any spectacle template. Deeper. The brass was heavy in his hand when he lifted one, and the interior surface had been machined with a precision that spoke of serious expenditure.

At the bottom of the crate, beneath another layer of straw, vellum. He drew out a sheet. Diagrams in brown ink, fine-lined, annotated in a hand that was not Bardolino's — smaller, more precise, the letters formed with a scholar's discipline. He could not read the text in this light. The diagrams showed circles within circles, measurements, angles marked with small careful numbers. He tilted the sheet toward the window but the light was failing, the afternoon sun already past the angle that fed the high glass, and the lines blurred into the grain of the skin.

He put the vellum back. Replaced the brass form in its oiled cloth. Smoothed the straw over the lenses. Set the lid down and pressed it until it seated, firm this time, flush. His hands were steady. His breath was not.

He picked up the two blanks he had come for and walked to the door. Stopped. Looked back at the crates along the far wall, their clean pine and fresh straw, their silence, their smell of brass and oil in a room that should have smelled of glass.

Then he stepped through the door and locked it behind him.
