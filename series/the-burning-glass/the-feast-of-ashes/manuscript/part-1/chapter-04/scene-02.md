The brass form was still warm from his hand. He picked it up again.

He turned it toward the window, rotating it the way his father had taught him — slow quarter-turns, letting the light find the surface at every angle. The interior curve was not a sphere. It was close, but the profile steepened near the edges, a deliberate departure from the radius that would have made it usable for spectacles or reading stones. Whoever had commissioned this template had specified a geometry Enzo did not recognize, and whoever had machined it had done so with tolerances that would have cost more than the brass itself.

He set it down and lifted one of the cristallo blanks with both hands. Heavy. Three fingers thick at the center, thinning toward the rim, the ground face catching the pale light and bending it. He held it at arm's length and looked through it at the far wall. The shelves there blurred, swelled, as any convex lens would make them do. Nothing remarkable. He rotated the blank a quarter-turn. The glass was clean. Cleaner than first-grade — this was cristallo refined beyond any commercial necessity, the kind of glass you made when cost was not a consideration and clarity was the only specification that mattered.

He replaced it and lifted the second blank. This one had a different grind — concave on its worked face, the hollow shallow but definite, and the curve matched the second brass template, the one with the steeper profile. He held it up. The far wall shrank, receded, as concave glass always did. He lowered it.

Two lenses ground to complementary curves, packed together, stored with templates that specified their geometry to the width of a hair. His father would have asked the obvious question. Enzo asked it now: what do they do together?

He picked up the convex blank in his left hand and the concave in his right. Held the convex closer to his face, perhaps a hand's span from his eye, and extended the concave to arm's length. Looked through both at the far wall.

The wall jumped.

The shelves — the old ledger, the boxes of grinding compound, the grain of the oak planking — all of it rushed toward him as though the room had contracted to half its depth. He could see the leather cracking on the ledger's spine. He could see the iron nail heads in the shelf brackets, their faces hammered flat, the small bright marks where the hammer had bitten. Details from across the room, ten paces away, rendered with the crispness of a hand's breadth.

He lowered the lenses. The wall retreated. The room was its proper size again, dim and ordinary.

He raised them. The wall leaped close.

His hands had stopped being steady. The blanks shook, and the image shook with them, the far shelves trembling as though seen through water. He set the concave blank down on the straw and pressed his right thumb hard across the roughened pads of his left fingers. The tremor did not stop. He set the convex blank down beside it.

Light gathered, bent, focused. Two pieces of glass and the distance between them — that was all. No mechanism, no trick, no craft he could not have performed himself at his own bench. His father could have done this. Any competent lens grinder could have done this, if he had known to try, if he had known that the geometry existed. The principle was simple. It should have been simple. But the distance it annihilated was not simple, and the precision of the blanks and templates said that whoever had designed them understood exactly what the distance would be.

This was not an experiment. This was production.

He knelt beside the crate and reached deeper into the straw, beneath where the blanks had lain, beneath the first layer of vellum he had already seen. His fingers found a second sheet, larger, folded twice. He drew it out and carried it to the window, holding it up in the last of the afternoon light.

The diagram was precise. A long rectangle — a tube — drawn in cross-section, with circles inside it representing lenses at measured intervals. Behind the final lens, at the far end of the tube, a set of angled lines that he recognized after a moment as mirrors. Small mirrors, tilted, arranged to redirect light from the lens array into a single converging point. The measurements were in Florentine braccia. The annotations were in Latin, the same small scholar's hand from the first sheet, and he could follow enough of it — lens, speculum, focus, radius — to understand the architecture if not the purpose.

At the bottom of the sheet, underlined twice, a phrase: *Speculum urens*.

Burning mirror.

He knew the term. Every glassmaker did. Archimedes at Syracuse, the old story, apocryphal or not — mirrors arranged to focus the sun's light on Roman ships until the wood caught fire. A burning mirror was not a lens for reading. It was not a device for correcting weak eyes or magnifying manuscript text. A burning mirror concentrated light the way a furnace concentrated heat, and a furnace could melt stone.

He folded the vellum along its creases and slid it back beneath the straw, pressing it flat, settling the blanks over it in their carved wooden forms. His fingers worked without consultation. They knew how to leave things as they were found.

Above him, a board creaked.

He stopped. The sound had come from the floor overhead — Bardolino's quarters, directly above the storeroom. A footstep, then another, the heavy deliberate tread of a large man crossing a room. A chair scraped.

Enzo replaced the second brass template in its oiled cloth. Smoothed the straw. His hands moved fast and precise, the motions of a craftsman accustomed to working under the time pressure of cooling glass. He seated the lid and pressed it flush, checking the gap with his fingertips — tight, even, no sliver of light showing through. Better than he had found it.

He stood. And saw, in the corner of the crate nearest the wall, what he had missed before: a small pile of blanks set apart from the others, six or seven of them, none larger than his palm. Rejects. He recognized the pile for what it was without thinking — every grinding shop kept one, the pieces that had cracked in cooling or come off the mold with bubbles or threads that no amount of polishing would remove. These were the waste of the larger blanks' production, kept because cristallo was expensive and even flawed pieces had salvage value, but set aside because they would never meet whatever specification the scholar's diagrams demanded.

He took one. A concave disc, perhaps eight centimeters across, with a fine thread running through it near one edge — the kind of flaw that would make it useless for precision work. It fit in his closed hand. He slipped it into the inner pocket of his doublet, where it settled against his thigh, cool and hard through the linen, a weight like a large coin. The pile looked the same without it. Rejects were not counted.

He crossed to the shelf where his two commission blanks waited in their linen wrappings. Took them, one in each hand. Walked to the door. Above him, the chair scraped again, and Bardolino's footsteps moved toward the stairs.

Enzo stepped through the door, turned the key in the new brass padlock, and pulled it shut. The lock's click was very small. The lens in his pocket pressed against his leg with each step — a circle of cold glass, flawed, worthless, and impossible to put back.
