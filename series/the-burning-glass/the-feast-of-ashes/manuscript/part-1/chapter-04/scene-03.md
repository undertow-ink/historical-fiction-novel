The new blank fit the grinding form with less than a hair's width of play. Enzo seated it, turned it once, twice, feeling for the faint catch that would tell him the curvature was off. Clean. He reached for the coarse paste and stopped. His hands were steady but his fingers carried the memory of what they had touched — the cold brass arcs, the straw, the smooth impossible curves of glass that had no name he knew. He wiped his palms on his apron and began again.

Behind him the workshop carried on. Two apprentices fed the annealing oven, their faces sheened with sweat. The furnace breathed its low constant roar through the room, and the heat came in waves that Enzo felt against the backs of his arms even at the grinding station. He poured a measure of paste onto the blank and took up the grinding wheel's handle.

Bardolino's boots on the stairs. Enzo knew the sound — the heavy deliberate tread, the slight drag of the left foot where the maestro's knee had stiffened years ago. He did not look up. The footsteps crossed the brick floor, paused at the annealing oven where Bardolino said something to one of the apprentices, then continued toward the grinding station.

"You found what you needed."

Not a question. Enzo glanced up. Bardolino stood at the edge of the station with his arms loose at his sides, but his gaze moved — to Enzo's hands, his apron front, the grinding form, the wrapped second blank on the shelf beside him. A quick inventory, thorough and unhurried, the way the maestro checked a finished piece for flaws. It could have been simple attention to the work. It could have been something else.

"The blanks were on the third shelf," Enzo said. "Where you told me."

He drew the brass key from his apron pocket and held it out. Bardolino took it. His enormous scarred fingers closed around the key and it disappeared into his fist, then into the pocket of his coat. The transaction took two seconds. Neither of them looked at the key while it passed between them.

"Good." Bardolino settled his weight against the station's post, the way he did when he meant to stay and talk. His pale eyes were warm. "Any trouble finding them? The room has gotten crowded, I know."

The lens pressed against Enzo's thigh, a disc of cold that his body heat had not yet reached. He turned the grinding handle a quarter revolution and checked the paste's spread.

"No trouble."

Bardolino nodded. He rubbed the stump of his left ring finger against his thumb — once, twice — then stopped, as if catching himself. "Those crates along the wall," he said. "I should have mentioned before I sent you down." His voice had settled into its lower register, easy, conversational, a maestro sharing workshop business with a trusted apprentice. "A private commission. There is a scholar in Padua — a natural philosopher, if you credit such men — who has more silver than sense. He wants novelty lenses. Parlor pieces. The kind of thing a man shows his dinner guests after the third carafe, you understand. Look through this, the candle appears to dance. That sort of foolishness."

He waved one hand, dismissing the Paduan scholar and his silver and his dinner guests in a single gesture. The explanation was smooth. Each detail fitted the next like segments of a millefiori rod — the scholar, the money, the frivolity, the implied condescension toward a man who would waste cristallo on tricks. Bardolino had told this story before, or rehearsed it, or both.

Enzo said nothing. He ground the blank. The paste hissed faintly under the wheel.

"It pays well enough," Bardolino continued. "And God knows we need the work. The Morosini commission will not carry us through summer." He paused. "The grinding specifications are unusual. I would not want you to see them out of context and draw the wrong conclusion."

There it was. The reason for the new lock, the restriction, the careful inventory of Enzo's hands and apron. Bardolino was not explaining. He was closing a door.

Enzo lifted the blank from the form and held it to the light from the high window. The cristallo was good. No threads, no bubbles, the surface already taking on the first rough translucence that polishing would bring to clarity. He set it back in the form.

"I did not look at the crates, Maestro."

The words came out flat and simple and true in their way — he had not been invited to look, and what he had done was not looking but something closer to trespass. Bardolino studied him for a moment. The furnace roared. One of the apprentices dropped a pontello and the clang rang across the brick floor and died.

"Good," Bardolino said again. Then his hand came down on Enzo's shoulder — broad, heavy, warm through the linen of his shirt. The grip was firm. Enzo could feel the calluses, the missing fingertip's absence where the ring finger pressed lighter than the rest. "Your father would have been proud of what you are doing with this Morosini piece, Enzo. The curvature work is as fine as anything Giacomo produced. I mean that."

The name went through him like heat through glass. His father's name in Bardolino's mouth, in Bardolino's hoarse deep voice, spoken with a tenderness that was not false — that was the worst of it, the tenderness was real, the hand on his shoulder was real, and three meters behind them a locked door held crates full of lenses ground to a precision that parlor toys did not require, and diagrams in a scholar's hand that described something Enzo had no word for, and his father was eight months dead and could be proud of nothing.

His thumb found his left fingertips. The roughened skin. He pressed hard.

"Thank you, Maestro."

Three words. Bardolino's hand stayed on his shoulder for another breath, and in that breath something passed across the maestro's face — a tightening at the corners of his pale eyes, not suspicion exactly, but an awareness, the recognition of a silence where more words should have been. Enzo met his gaze. Held it. Let it go.

Bardolino lifted his hand. He straightened, tugged the hem of his coat, and looked toward the furnace where the apprentices were loading a fresh crucible.

"Finish the rough grinding today if you can," he said. "I want to see the curvature before you move to fine paste." His voice was the maestro's voice again, brisk and practical, the voice that ran a furnace and employed twelve men and kept the fires burning through the night. He crossed the workshop floor without looking back.

Enzo turned the grinding handle. The paste hissed. The blank spun in its form, and the high windows threw pale April light across his hands, and the furnace breathed, and the apprentices called to each other over the roar, and the lens in his pocket pressed its flawed cold circle against his thigh with every motion of his arm.
