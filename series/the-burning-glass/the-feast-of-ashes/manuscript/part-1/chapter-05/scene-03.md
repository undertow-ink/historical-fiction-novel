The ink was cold. Bardolino held the pot near the candle flame until the surface loosened, then dipped the pen and tested a stroke across scrap vellum — the line ran thin but even, and he drew the fresh sheet toward him and began.

*Esteemed Signor Viaro,*

*I write to confirm receipt of your latest specifications and to report on the progress of your commission. Thirty-eight of the fifty samples have been completed and inspected. The grinding holds tolerances well within the parameters you established, and the curvature of the most recent twelve exceeds, I believe, the quality of the first twenty-six. The soda-ash blend I have adopted for these later pieces produces a clarity that I had not thought achievable at this scale, and I am satisfied that when you present them to your buyers, they will find no cause for complaint.*

*The remaining twelve units can proceed on the agreed schedule. I anticipate completion before the Feast of the Ascension, weather and fuel supply permitting. The mirror components require a different grinding jig, which my workshop is constructing now, and the smaller prismatic elements present particular challenges that I will address once the primary order is fulfilled.*

*I would welcome your thoughts on delivery. The samples are stored securely and can be transported at your convenience. I suggest the method we discussed — individual wrapping in oiled linen, packed in sawdust, delivered in three consignments rather than one. This reduces the risk of breakage and attracts less attention from the customs inspectors at the fondaco, who have lately taken an interest in bulk glass shipments leaving the island.*

*Your continued trust in this workshop is appreciated. I remain, as always, your servant in the craft.*

He read it back. The words sat on the vellum with the bland authority of routine commerce — a glassmaker writing to a merchant about an order, nothing more, the kind of letter that passed through dozens of hands between Murano and the mainland without anyone pausing over a phrase. Every sentence was true. Every sentence was false. The lenses were lenses; the specifications were specifications; the delivery was a delivery. What they were for, what they would become when fitted into the brass housing whose dimensions he had memorized and burned — that lived nowhere on the page.

Bardolino signed it, sanded the ink, shook the excess into the tray. From the desk's lower drawer he took a stick of sealing wax and held it to the candle until a dark red bead formed and dropped onto the folded edge. He pressed his ring into it. The Bardolino crest — a furnace flame above crossed blowpipes — sank into the wax and held.

He set the letter aside.

The cabinet key hung on a cord around his neck, beneath his shirt, where it lay against his sternum like a second pulse. He unlocked the walnut doors and drew out the leather folder, untied its cord, and spread the diagrams across the desk beside the cooling letter.

Fra Giordano's hand was terrible and extraordinary. The lines of the optical housing had been drawn with a reed pen in ink so dense it was almost black-green, the strokes manic, hurried, correcting themselves mid-curve — and yet precise, every angle annotated in a Latin so compressed that three words carried the work of a paragraph. Bardolino's Latin was functional, a craftsman's Latin, sufficient for contracts and guild correspondence. Half of what the friar wrote escaped him. But the drawings needed no translation. He could read a technical diagram the way a musician reads notation, and what he saw in these pages was a mind working at the far edge of what theory could describe — a system of compounded lenses and angled mirrors that gathered light and bent it through successive stages of refinement until it emerged, according to the friar's calculations, magnified beyond anything the naked eye could achieve.

The design was beautiful. There was no other word. The proportions of the housing, the calculated distances between lens elements, the elegant solution to the problem of chromatic separation that had defeated every optician Bardolino had ever spoken with — all of it bore the unmistakable signature of a first-rate mind operating without constraint, without caution, without any apparent awareness that what he had designed on paper would need to be built by hands in a world of thermal expansion and grinding error and glass that did not always do what glass was asked to do. The friar's confidence was total. His annotations assumed perfection.

Bardolino traced the curve of the primary lens housing with his fingertip — the scarred one, the one that ended at the first knuckle where the shear had taken the rest twenty years ago. The brass would need to be machined to tolerances that no instrument maker in Venice could reliably hold. The lens seats would need to be —

Footsteps on the stairs.

He had the diagrams back in the folder and the folder in the cabinet and the cabinet locked before the steps reached the landing. The letter he slid beneath the open account book. When Caterina pushed the door with her hip, both hands occupied with the wooden tray, she found him bent over columns of figures, squinting in the candlelight as if he had been there for hours.

"You have not eaten," she said.

"I was coming down."

"You were not." She set the tray on the corner of the desk — bread, a wedge of hard cheese, a handful of oil-cured olives in a small clay bowl, a cup of watered wine. The bread was yesterday's, because she had not had time to bake today; she had spent the afternoon scrubbing the kitchen floor and mending the hem of her only good dress, the green one she wore to Mass, the one her mother had cut for her two sizes too large so she could grow into it. She had grown into it. "There is nothing else. The market was poor."

"This is enough. Thank you, Cati."

She straightened the candle in its holder, pinched a guttering wick on the second candle and relit it from the first. Her hands moved through the room with the proprietary ease of someone who had been managing this household since she was thirteen, who knew where everything was and how everything worked and what her father would forget to do if she did not do it for him. She was not yet seventeen. Her hair was pulled back in a plain linen wrap, and in the warm light she looked, for a moment, so much like Alessandra that Bardolino's hand stopped halfway to the bread.

"Papa." She was straightening the books on the shelf by the window, her back to him. "Why is the storeroom lock different?"

The question came without weight. A household question, the kind she asked about candle stores and firewood deliveries and whether the ash man had been paid. She had not turned around.

"What?"

"The brass lock. On the storeroom. It is new."

"The old one was sticking," he said. Too fast. "I had it replaced."

She turned then, and looked at him, and whatever she saw in his face — the set of his mouth, the way his hand had stopped, the flicker of something behind his eyes that he could not govern — she did not pursue. Her expression did not change so much as close, the way a window shutter swings to without being latched, the view still there behind the wood but no longer offered. She smoothed her apron.

"You should eat before it gets any harder," she said, meaning the bread, and she left, pulling the door closed behind her with the careful, deliberate click of someone who had learned not to slam things in this house, not because she had been told but because slamming was a luxury that belonged to people who still expected their anger to be heard.

The stairs creaked beneath her. Then silence.

Bardolino looked at the tray. The bread. The cheese. The olives glistening in their oil. The sealed letter beneath the account book. The locked cabinet. He pulled the tray toward him and ate, and the bread was stale and good and caught in his throat, and he washed it down with the thin wine and ate the cheese and three of the olives and left the rest.

Below, through the heavy oak floor, the furnace ticked — the slow, arrhythmic contraction of brick and iron cooling at different rates, the sound a furnace makes when it is banked for the night and left to its own red, diminishing work. He knew the sound the way he knew his own breathing. Forty years of nights above that voice. It had comforted him once. His wife had slept to it. His daughter had been born to it.

The candle guttered. He did not trim it. The ticking continued, patient and indifferent, and Bardolino sat at his desk with the crumbs and the empty cup and the letter and the locked cabinet and the closed door, and the walls drew close, and the warmth rose through the floor, and it was not enough.
