The stool creaked when he sat. Eight months of dust on the seat, a fine grey film that clung to his breeches, and he did not wipe it. He set both hands flat on the workbench. The wood was scored and stained, pocked with old burns where Giacomo had rested hot tools, and the grain had been worn smooth under his father's forearms in two pale arcs that Enzo's arms did not quite fill.

He breathed. The house was quiet. His mother had gone to draw water from the well in the campo, and through the open window came the distant clatter of a handcart on stone, a child's voice, the low complaint of pigeons on the roof tiles. The main room smelled of dried rosemary and the cold ash in the brazier and, beneath that, something older — linseed oil, brass filings, the particular mineral sharpness of ground glass that had seeped into the wood itself and would not leave.

The calipers lay where Giacomo had left them. Enzo picked them up. The hinge was stiff with disuse, and he worked it open and closed twice, feeling the familiar resistance, the slight burr at the midpoint of the arc where his father had never gotten around to filing smooth. Beside the calipers: two grinding forms, their concave surfaces still chalked with the radius markings Giacomo used. A small hand lathe clamped to the bench's edge. A square of chamois leather, folded once. A stub of marking chalk.

He drew the lens from the cloth in his doublet.

In the workshop it had been difficult to study. Here, in the thin light from the window, he could hold it up and turn it and see. Cristallo, and not the clouded sort that Murano's lesser furnaces produced — this was water-clear, the colour of nothing, with a faint greenish cast at the thickest point that spoke of iron kept scrupulously low in the batch. Whoever had mixed this melt knew his craft down to the grain weight. Enzo tilted the lens and watched the window light pass through it and throw a bright disc on the far wall, distorted and swimming.

He opened the calipers and set them to the lens's diameter. Forty-two millimetri, give or take a hair. His father's calipers were marked in the old Venetian scale, each division scratched into the brass by hand, and he read them the way Giacomo had taught him — by feel as much as sight, the pad of his thumb finding the etched line. Then he turned the lens on its edge and measured the thickness at the centre and at the rim. Centre: six millimetri. Rim: two. A plano-convex profile, one side flat, the other a smooth curve.

The curvature. He needed the radius.

He set the lens flat-side down on the chamois leather and laid the straight edge of the caliper arm across the top. The gap between the straight edge and the lens surface at its deepest point — the sagitta — was what mattered. He measured it twice. Just over two millimetri. His father's voice came back without effort, the way a prayer comes back: the radius equals the square of the half-diameter divided by twice the sagitta, plus half the sagitta itself. Giacomo had made him recite it at this bench until he could do it in his sleep.

Half-diameter: twenty-one. Squared: four hundred forty-one. Twice the sagitta: call it four. That gave one hundred ten, plus one for the half-sagitta. A radius of one hundred eleven millimetri, roughly.

He held the number. The focal length of a plano-convex lens ran close to twice the radius. Two hundred twenty-two millimetri — no. He checked himself. For cristallo, with its higher refractive character, the focal length shortened. His father had kept a table of corrections, but Enzo did not need it; the values lived in his hands the way intervals live in a singer's throat. Cristallo bent light more sharply. The true focal length would fall near three braccia. Perhaps a fraction under.

Three braccia. He set the calipers down.

A reading lens focused at the distance of an outstretched arm, sometimes less. A lens for spectacles focused at two or three times that. A lens ground to converge light at exactly three braccia served one purpose that Enzo knew, and his father had described it to him once, years ago, with the caution that such things were not toys: a burning lens. A lens that gathered sunlight to a point so concentrated it could char wood, blister lead, set tinder alight from a distance.

But this lens was too small. Forty-two millimetri across — it could light a candle, perhaps scorch a fingertip. Not more. To generate true heat, killing heat, furnace heat, you would need many such lenses. Dozens. You would need to mount them in a frame, angle each one so that every focal point converged on the same spot, layer the light until it became something else entirely.

An array.

He turned and looked at the wall as though he could see through it, across the water, to the storeroom on Murano where the crates were stacked. Three lenses in the first crate, packed in straw. Six crates. Seven. He had not counted them all.

The diagram surfaced behind his eyes. Speculum urens. The circles arranged in concentric rings. The ruled lines of convergence meeting at a single mark.

His thumb found his left fingertips and rubbed across the rough calluses there, back and forth, pressing hard enough to feel the whorls of his own skin.

The door opened.

His mother came in with the water jug braced on her hip, her kerchief damp at the temples. She set the jug on the table, and when she turned toward the window she saw him at the bench and went still. Her hand stayed on the jug's handle. Her lips parted and closed again, and the skin around her eyes drew tight in a way that had nothing to do with the light.

She came closer. Her gaze moved over the opened calipers, the chamois leather, the grinding forms, and then found the lens where it lay on the cloth.

"Where did you get that?" she said.

"A piece from the workshop. I'm studying the curvature."

The words came out smooth and practised, and they sickened him even as he spoke them, because he recognized the tone — calm, plausible, just detailed enough to discourage further questions. He had heard this tone before. Three days ago, from Bardolino, standing in the workshop with dust on his apron: parlour toys for a Paduan scholar.

Mirela studied the lens. She did not pick it up.

"Your father used to say, the man who borrows trouble from tomorrow robs himself today." Her voice was quiet, not quite a whisper. She looked at him — at his hands on the workbench, his arms in the pale arcs worn by Giacomo's arms — and something moved behind her eyes that he could not name and that she did not allow to reach the rest of her face. "Eat before the bread goes stale. I left cheese on the cloth."

She touched his shoulder as she passed into the sleeping chamber. Her fingers were cold and rough from the well water, and they pressed once, briefly, before letting go.

He sat with the lens on the cloth and the calipers open and his father's chalk marks on the grinding forms and the sound of his mother moving behind the curtain, the creak of the clothes chest opening and closing.

Then he wrapped the lens in the chamois leather, folding the corners in the way Giacomo had folded his finished work — snug, no edges exposed. He crossed to the far wall near his pallet and knelt. The third board from the corner had always been loose; the nail at its south end had worked free years ago and Giacomo had never fixed it, and when Enzo pressed the board's north end it tilted up like a lever, releasing a breath of cold air from the gap between the floor joists. Below was dust, a rusted nail, a darkness that smelled of old wood and the canal. He set the wrapped lens inside and eased the board flat.

When he stood, the floor looked as it always had. He brushed the dust from his knees. Through the window, light off the canal made its slow crawl across the ceiling plaster, touching the crack there and moving on, and the pigeons on the roof tiles went on with their low, stupid, endless talk.
