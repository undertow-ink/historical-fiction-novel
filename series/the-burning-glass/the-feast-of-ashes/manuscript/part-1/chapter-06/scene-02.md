The roar of the Rialto fell away by degrees. First the fish sellers, whose voices carried farthest, then the cloth merchants calling prices in Venetian and bastard Greek, then the money changers with their quiet arithmetic, and then Enzo turned from the fondamenta into a calle so narrow his shoulders nearly touched both walls and the noise dropped to a murmur, then to nothing, and he stood before a painted sign — an open book, its colors faded by salt air — and a door that was, as always, slightly ajar.

He pushed it open. The smell reached him before his eyes adjusted: paper and leather and the waxy residue of candles burned down to their dishes, and beneath it something older, the dust of parchment slowly becoming powder. A single room, not much wider than the calle outside, crammed with books from the stone floor to the low beams. Stacked on shelves, wedged sideways, piled on a table where three volumes lay open with strips of cloth marking their places. A reading lectern stood near the window. Dust moved in the light there, turning and turning in no wind he could feel.

Gritti was behind the table, bent over a codex, his thick spectacles almost touching the page. He looked up at the sound of the door and blinked — one blink, two, as if surfacing from water.

"Sforno," he said. "Good. Yes. Come in, come in."

"Maestro Bardolino sent me," Enzo said. "He wants the guild regulations. The new printing."

"The statuti? Yes, I have it, I set it aside — where did I —" Gritti turned, patting the stacks on his left with one ink-stained hand, then the stacks on his right, then reaching behind him to a shelf where a slim octavo volume sat propped against a rolled map. "Here. Aldus printed this in March. Clean work. Good type. Three lire, tell Bardolino, and remind him he still owes me for the Ptolemy."

Enzo took the book and tucked it under his arm. He should leave. He had the errand done and the day was not long and Bardolino would want him back at the grinding bench before the afternoon light shifted.

He did not leave.

"I wanted to ask you something," he said.

Gritti settled onto his stool, which creaked. "Ask."

"Burning mirrors." Enzo kept his voice flat, workmanlike. "I read somewhere — I don't remember where — that there were scholars who believed a curved mirror could concentrate sunlight. Set fires at a distance. Is that — did anyone write seriously about that?"

Gritti's hand went to his spectacles. He adjusted them, pushing them higher on his nose, and the gesture seemed to open something in his face the way a bellows opens a furnace.

"Seriously?" Gritti said. "My boy, they wrote about almost nothing else. You are speaking of one of the great problems of natural philosophy. Archimedes — you know the story of Archimedes at Syracuse?"

"The Roman ships," Enzo said. "He burned them with mirrors."

"With mirrors, yes, or so the histories claim — Galen mentions it, Anthemius of Tralles describes the geometry, and whether Archimedes truly did this or whether the story is a beautiful exaggeration has occupied better minds than mine for two hundred years, but the principle, Sforno, the principle is not in doubt." Gritti was on his feet now, moving along the shelves with the careful speed of a man who knew exactly where each book lived in his disorder. His fingers walked across the spines. "The question is not whether curved mirrors can concentrate light and heat — any glassmaker knows this, you yourself must know it from your craft — the question is the geometry of concentration, the ratio of aperture to focal distance, the problem of spherical aberration which degrades the image and scatters the —" He stopped. Drew out a heavy volume bound in brown calf. "Here. Roger Bacon. The Opus Majus. Written for Pope Clement, oh, two hundred and thirty years ago, more or less."

He set the book on the lectern and opened it, turning pages with a gentleness that looked strange in his thick fingers. The paper was good — Venetian rag, dense and cream-colored.

"Bacon describes it plainly," Gritti said. He ran his finger along a line of Latin. "Specula comburentia — burning mirrors. He claims, and I translate loosely, that such a device could concentrate the rays of the sun to produce fire at whatever distance the geometry permits, and that this fire could consume armies, could burn fortifications, could —" He looked up over his spectacles. "Bacon was a Franciscan friar, you understand. He wrote this for the Pope. He was not writing fables."

"He believed it could be built," Enzo said.

"He believed it had been built. By Archimedes, by the ancients, and that the knowledge had been lost and could be recovered through the study of optics." Gritti tapped the open page. "But Bacon — brilliant as he was, and he was brilliant, Sforno, make no mistake — Bacon was building on foundations he freely acknowledged. The mathematics of reflection, of refraction, of the behavior of light passing through curved surfaces — this does not begin with Bacon."

"Who, then?"

Gritti adjusted his spectacles again. He leaned back against the shelf behind him and it groaned under his weight and the weight of all the books pressing against his shoulders.

"Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham," he said, pronouncing it carefully, with respect. "The Latins call him Alhazen. An Arab, born in Basra, worked in Cairo under the Fatimid caliph. Died perhaps four hundred and fifty years ago. He wrote the Kitab al-Manazir — the Book of Optics. It was translated into Latin, oh, a long time ago, and it changed everything. Everything, Sforno. Before Alhazen, the study of light was philosophy. After Alhazen, it was science — observation, measurement, geometry. Bacon knew this. Bacon built his entire understanding of optics on Alhazen's work and said so in plain words."

The dust turned in the window light. Somewhere outside, muffled by walls and books, a gondolier called a warning at a canal turning.

"If you want to understand what is truly possible with lenses and mirrors," Gritti said, "not the craft of it, which you already know, but the theory — the why and the how far and the what if — you must read Alhazen."

"Do you have it?"

Gritti pulled off his spectacles and polished them on his gown, squinting at Enzo with naked, watering eyes. Without the lenses his face looked younger and oddly vulnerable, a soft face that had spent its years indoors.

"I have a manuscript copy," he said. "Latin translation. Not complete — books one through five, which are the essential portions. I bought it from a student at Padua who needed money more than knowledge, which tells you something about students at Padua." He put his spectacles back on and Enzo came back into focus for him. "Why does a lens grinder want Alhazen?"

"I grind lenses every day," Enzo said. "I don't understand what the light does after it passes through."

This was true. It was not the whole truth, but it was true, and Gritti seemed to hear it that way — as a craftsman's honest hunger for the principles beneath his trade. The bookseller nodded.

"You are like your father. Giacomo asked me once about Euclid's Optica and I lent it to him for a month and he returned it with notes in the margins that were better than half the commentary I've read from Padua." He turned and moved to the back of the shop, ducking through a low doorway into the binding room. Enzo heard him rummaging — the slide of paper, the knock of a box lid. He came back holding a manuscript bound in plain vellum, not large, its pages slightly warped from the damp that got into everything in Venice.

"Treat it gently," Gritti said. "This is not a printed book I can replace from Aldus's shop. This is the only copy I have and I cannot afford another." He wrapped it in a cloth — linen, clean — and tied the bundle with cord, and his ink-stained fingers worked the knot with the same care Enzo used wrapping a finished lens. "Bring it back within the month. And tell Bardolino he owes me for the Ptolemy."

Enzo took the manuscript. It was lighter than he expected. He paid the three lire for the guild statuti, put both bundles under his arm, and stepped out into the calle.

The Rialto hit him like heat from a Glory Hole. Noise first — the overlapping voices of vendors and buyers and porters, Venetian dialect and Lombard and the sharp consonants of German traders from the Fondaco — then the smell of fish and overripe fruit and the salt mud of the canal at low tide, and then the press of bodies, hundreds of them moving in every direction through the market stalls and across the bridge, and Enzo entered the crowd the way a glass rod enters the furnace mouth, all at once.

A cloth seller's elbow caught his shoulder. He pulled the bundles tighter against his ribs. The yellow circle on his doublet caught the sun and a porter's eyes flicked to it and away, a glance that registered and dismissed him in the same motion, and Enzo kept walking. Under his arm, wrapped in linen, a dead man from Cairo explained the geometry of light to anyone who could read the Latin, and the crowd flowed around Enzo like canal water around a piling and did not know, and he passed among them carrying what Archimedes might have used to burn a fleet, and the fish sellers shouted their prices, and the sun was on the water, and he walked home.
