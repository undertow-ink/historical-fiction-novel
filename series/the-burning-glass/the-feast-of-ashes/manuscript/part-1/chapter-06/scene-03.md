Salt water on wood. The oar dipped and the lagoon took it, black and heavy, resisting for a moment before the blade found its angle and the sandolo moved forward, and the wake curled away behind him in a line he could not see but knew was there, the way a grinder knows the curve is forming beneath the grit before his fingers confirm it. The lights of Venice had begun to separate — the dense warm cluster of the Fondamente Nove breaking apart as distance pulled them into individual flames, each lantern finding its own darkness, its own small territory of light on water. The manuscript sat in his lap, wrapped in Gritti's linen, and the weight of it pressed against his thighs with the faint give of warped vellum beneath cloth.

He rowed. The rhythm was old. His arms knew it the way they knew the grinding wheel — not thinking, only doing, the body's memory of ten thousand crossings encoded in the pull and recovery of muscle, the shift of weight from foot to foot as the oar changed sides, the slight lean into the stroke that kept the sandolo tracking true across the flat black water. Stars overhead. Not many — a haze had come in from the east, the kind that thinned the sky without clouding it, and the stars that survived were pale, hard, distant points that gave no warmth. The air smelled of salt and the mineral breath of mud exposed at low tide somewhere to the north, the barene flats where herons stood in the shallows at dawn.

The manuscript pressed against him. Under the linen, under the cord Gritti had tied with his careful ink-stained fingers, the vellum pages held the geometry of light — how it traveled, how it bent, how it could be gathered and concentrated and turned upon itself until what had been illumination became combustion. Alhazen had understood this. Had measured it, diagrammed it, reduced it to angles and ratios that a man could reproduce if he had the skill and the glass and the patience. Enzo had not read the manuscript yet. He did not need to. Gritti had given him the shape of it in that cramped shop with dust turning in the window light, and the shape was enough, because the shape confirmed what his hands had already told him at his father's workbench — the focal length, the curvature, the convergence of forty-two millimetri of cristallo ground to a precision that served no purpose he wanted to name.

Speculum urens. The Latin sat behind his teeth like a taste. Burning mirror.

His father's voice came without warning — not words, not even a sentence, but the particular cadence Giacomo used when reciting a formula, the rise on the variable and the drop on the constant, as steady and patterned as the oar's stroke in the water. The radius equals the square of the half-diameter divided by twice the sagitta. He had heard it a hundred times at the workbench, had recited it back until the numbers lived in his mouth the way prayers lived in his mother's, and now the formula turned inside him like something swallowed whole, because it was no longer arithmetic. It was evidence. Three braccia. The focal length of a burning lens, ground from cristallo so clear that iron must have been kept below a tenth of a percent in the batch, packed in straw in crates in a locked storeroom behind a new brass lock on a door that Bardolino opened only for men in dark silk who arrived by private gondola and departed without names.

The oar cut the water. The water healed behind it.

Gritti had spoken of Archimedes without alarm, the way scholars spoke of old marvels — with admiration, with qualification, with the comfortable distance of men who studied fire but did not build furnaces. For Gritti, the speculum urens was a problem of geometry, elegant, ancient, solved in theory and lost in practice. For Enzo it was six crates of straw-packed lenses and a diagram pinned to the inside wall of a room he was forbidden to enter. The distance between those two understandings was the distance he was rowing now — Venice behind him, Murano ahead, and the black water between holding nothing, reflecting nothing, offering no counsel.

He tried to think of the storeroom as he had always thought of it. A locked room. Every workshop had locked rooms — materials, records, the private concerns of a master that were none of an apprentice's business. He tried to restore the lock to its old place in his understanding, the ordinary iron padlock pitted with rust, as much a part of the door as the hinges. But the brass would not go back to iron. The new would not become old again. He had held the lens to the candle on his father's workbench and seen the light gather to a point, and the point had burned through something that could not be repaired — not the chamois, not the wood, but the membrane between what he knew and what he had chosen not to know, and the knowing was irreversible, the way a crack in annealed glass is irreversible, invisible to the casual eye but structurally present, a flaw that will propagate under the next stress and the next until the whole piece fails along a line that was determined the moment the crack began.

A lens grinder cannot unsee a flaw. His father had said that. Or Bardolino had. The two voices had blurred over the years, master and father, the living and the dead, and he could no longer always tell which hand had shaped which lesson. This troubled him in a place below thought.

Ahead, the fires of Murano.

He saw them first as a thickening of the darkness at the horizon — not light yet, but the absence of full dark, a smudge of orange where the sky met the water and the furnaces of the island bled their heat into both. Then the glow resolved, separating into distinct sources as distance closed: the Contarini furnace to the north, its chimney a black stroke against the orange; the Ballarin works closer to the water, squat and bright; and between them, set back from the fondamenta on the slight rise where the ground was firmest, the Bardolino furnace.

The chimney. Pale smoke trailing from it the way it always trailed, because a furnace never fully died, not if you meant to use it again. He had seen that smoke every night of his apprenticeship, had watched it from this same angle on a hundred crossings — a signal of home, of the work waiting, of the craft that had taken him in when his father's death had left him with nothing but a pair of trained hands and a knowledge of glass that no grief could burn out of him. The smoke had meant warmth. It had meant the low ticking of cooling brick and the red glow behind the grate and the smell of ash and silica that was the smell of his life. It had meant Bardolino's hand on his shoulder, steadying him at the glory hole on his first day, the deep voice saying easy, easy, let the glass tell you what it wants.

The smoke trailed. The chimney stood. Nothing had changed.

Everything had changed. The same smoke that meant home now carried something else inside it — not visible, not smellable, not different in any way his senses could identify, but present the way a flaw is present in a lens that still transmits light, still focuses, still functions, but will one day, under the wrong pressure, split along the line of its hidden weakness. The chimney was the chimney. The smoke was the smoke. And beneath them, behind the soot-dark brick, inside the locked room with its bright brass hasp, the components of a weapon sat in their straw and waited for the hands that would assemble them, and those hands — the broad, scarred, patient hands that had taught Enzo to hold a pontil, to read a melt, to trust his fingers when his eyes could not help him — those hands belonged to the man who had fed him and sheltered him and given him the only life he had.

The sandolo rocked as the current shifted near the shallows. Enzo shipped the oar and let the boat glide. The dock was close now. He could see the mooring posts, the dark shapes of other boats tied and still, the stone edge of the fondamenta where the water lapped with the small persistent sound of something patient trying to get in.

He lifted the manuscript from his lap. The linen was damp where it had pressed against his breeches, and he held it against his chest, one arm across it. Under the cloth, the vellum held four hundred years of light's geometry — the angles and the ratios and the proof that what Archimedes had done at Syracuse could be done again, was perhaps being done now, in the storeroom of the man who called him ragazzo and corrected his grinding and carved the festival meat at the table where Enzo sat as if he were a second child.

He stepped onto the dock. The wood was solid under his feet after the water's give. He tied the sandolo's line to the post with the knot Bardolino had taught him — two wraps, a half hitch, a tug to test — and stood, and the night air carried the furnace smoke to him, and he breathed it, and it tasted the way it had always tasted, of ash and work and the long burning that never stopped, and he walked toward it with the dead man's manuscript held close against his ribs and the live man's chimney smoking above him, and the dock boards did not creak any differently beneath his feet, and the water did not change its sound, and nothing in the world had moved except the single thing that mattered, which was that he could see it now, all of it, the way cooling glass resolves from a bright blur into its final shape — clear, fixed, and no longer capable of becoming anything other than what it was.
