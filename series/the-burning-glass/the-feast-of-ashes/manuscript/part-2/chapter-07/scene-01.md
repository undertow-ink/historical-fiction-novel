Smoke from the great hall's chimney bent south across the canal, and the stone facade of the Palazzo da Mula caught the morning light on surfaces Enzo had only ever seen from the water. Up close the walls were not smooth. They were pitted, salt-eaten, the pale Istrian stone scarred in long vertical runs where rain had worked at it for two hundred years. He followed Bardolino through the entrance and into a corridor that smelled of damp plaster and tallow and something older beneath those, a mineral coldness that workshops never held. The floor was terrazzo, not packed earth. His feet made no sound on it.

The meeting hall opened at the corridor's end, and it was larger than any room Enzo had been inside. Wooden benches ran in rows toward a raised dais where three chairs stood behind a table draped in dark cloth. Above the table, carved into the wall in shallow relief, the lion of San Marco held its open book between two glassblower's pipes crossed like swords. The windows on the canal side were tall, their glass — Murano glass, of course — set in diamond leads that threw small bright lozenges across the floor and the shoulders of the men already seated. Thirty or forty masters filled the front benches. Their voices layered into a single rough sound, dialect thick as furnace smoke, punctuated by laughter that carried the particular sharpness of men who knew each other too well.

Bardolino had not spoken since they'd left the fondamenta. He walked to the front now with a different body than the one he wore at the furnace. His shoulders were drawn back. His stride measured itself to the room's proportions, unhurried, proprietary, as though the terrazzo owed something to his feet. Two masters rose to greet him. He clasped the first by the forearm, said something Enzo could not hear, and the man laughed — a real laugh, surprised out of him. The second master leaned close and spoke rapidly. Bardolino nodded once, twice, then turned his head and found Enzo standing three paces behind.

"The bench behind mine," he said. "Sit. Keep the papers in order."

Enzo sat. The bench was polished by decades of guild meetings, the wood worn to the color of dark honey. He set the leather folio across his knees and looked at the room the way he looked at a new lens blank — surface first, then the thing beneath the surface.

The front bench on the right side held the Contarini men. Maestro Contarini himself sat at its center, a man Enzo had seen perhaps twice, always at a distance: broad, white-bearded, his hands still enormous even in age, the fingers permanently reddened by forty years of proximity to molten glass. His son-in-law Baldan sat beside him, narrow where Contarini was wide, with a face that watched everything and gave back nothing. To the left, a cluster of younger masters Enzo did not recognize occupied the benches with a restless energy. They leaned toward each other. They passed papers. One of them, a man of perhaps thirty with a close-trimmed beard and ink on his cuffs, was marking a document with quick strokes of a graphite stick.

Maestro Contarini turned. His gaze crossed Enzo's face, dropped to the rotella gialla sewn on Enzo's left breast, and came back up. He raised one ruined hand in a small gesture that might have been a greeting or a benediction. The distinction did not matter. The acknowledgment did.

No one else looked at Enzo. He had not expected them to.

A bell rang — actual bronze, struck by a mallet in the hand of a clerk on the dais. The voices fell away in ragged sequence, back rows first, then the middle, then the front, where two masters finished their exchange with the unhurried defiance of men who would not be told when to stop talking. The clerk opened the mariegola on its lectern. The great book's pages were vellum, heavy, the edges dark with handling. He read the opening invocation in formal Italian that sat strangely in his Murano mouth, then switched to dialect for the business of the day.

Three items on the agenda. The first was a dispute over furnace hours between two houses Enzo had never heard of, resolved in minutes by a ruling so clearly predetermined that both parties accepted it without argument. The second was an assessment for the repair of the guild's dock. Bardolino voted with the majority. His hand rose at precisely the moment six other hands rose, not before, not after, and Enzo understood that even the timing of a raised hand was a kind of language here.

The third item broke the room open.

The young master with the ink-stained cuffs stood. His name was Trevisan — Enzo caught it from the clerk's recognition — and he spoke with the controlled precision of a man who had rehearsed.

"The question before us is whether the restriction against mainland practice serves the guild or starves it," Trevisan said. "Padua, Ferrara, Verona — they make glass now. Poor glass, yes. But they sell it cheap, and our agents in those markets report losses of a third in two years. A third. We sit on this island and pretend the world cannot learn what we know, while the world learns it without us and sells it for less."

The silence that followed was not silence at all. It was a held breath, a crucible before the pour.

Bardolino's back, directly in front of Enzo, did not move. But his right hand, resting on his thigh, opened and closed once.

A master named Gasparo — old, bald, his voice a furnace rasp — spoke from the right side without standing. "The world learns nothing. The world melts sand and calls it glass. A Paduan bottle breaks if you look at it wrong. This is not competition. This is mud pretending to be crystal."

Laughter from the traditionalist benches. Trevisan waited for it to pass.

"Mud that costs one-fifth of crystal," he said. "The buyer in Ferrara does not hold his wine to the light and admire the clarity. He pours, he drinks, he buys another when it breaks. We are losing the common trade to save our pride."

"We are losing nothing." Maestro Contarini's voice carried without effort. He did not stand either. He did not need to. "What we hold is not pride. It is law. The Consiglio dei Dieci protects our art because our art protects the Republic. The secrets of this island are secrets of state. A man who carries them to the mainland — or God forbid, across the Alps — does not face a fine. He faces the Council's agents. We all know this. We swore to this."

The room shifted. Not a sound, but a collective drawing-in, the way a crowd contracts around a dropped blade. Enzo's hands tightened on the folio. The Council's agents. He had known this — everyone on Murano knew it, the way everyone knew the tides — but hearing it spoken aloud in this room, by that voice, with the mariegola open on the lectern and the lion watching from the wall, turned knowledge into something that pressed against his ribs.

If the secret of a glass recipe could bring a man's death, what was the penalty for a weapon that could burn a ship from a thousand braccia?

He did not let the thought complete itself. He looked at the folio. He counted the pages. Seven, eight, nine. All present, all in order.

Trevisan tried again. "No one speaks of secrets. I speak of common techniques —"

"There are no common techniques." This was Bardolino. He stood as he spoke, and the standing was the argument. His full height, the breadth of his chest, the decades of smoke and heat that had weathered his face into something that looked carved from the same Istrian stone as the walls. "Every technique practiced on this island is a technique of this island. The moment we allow the word 'common' to divide our art into what may leave and what must stay, we have opened a door that will never close. Trevisan, you are young. You see the loss of the common trade and call it a crisis. I have seen three such crises. They pass. What does not pass is the destruction of the monopoly."

He sat. The motion was final, the way a pontil rod sets down a finished piece. Enzo watched the masters on the left side of the room. Trevisan's allies had gone still. The man with the graphite stick had stopped writing.

The vote was called. The restriction held, twenty-nine to eleven. Trevisan voted with his faction and sat down afterward with his hands flat on his knees, and Enzo recognized the posture. It was the posture of a man measuring the distance between where he stood and where he needed to be. It was the posture of patience, not defeat.

Bardolino received congratulations as the room emptied, handclasps and murmured words from the right-side benches. Maestro Contarini gripped his arm and spoke into his ear, and Bardolino laughed — not the large public laugh but a low one, almost private, the laugh of shared understanding between old allies. From behind, Enzo could see the line of Bardolino's neck relax. The performance was ending. The body was remembering itself.

They walked out together into hard sunlight. The canal glittered. A transport barge loaded with sand moved toward the eastern furnaces, its hull riding low.

"Well?" Bardolino said. He did not look at Enzo. He watched the barge.

"Trevisan will bring it back," Enzo said.

Bardolino's head turned. His eyes held something Enzo could not read — surprise, perhaps, or its near cousin, reassessment. "Yes," he said. "He will. He'll wait for a year when trade drops again, and he'll bring his numbers, and the young masters will have added two or three to their side. That is how it works. Not in a single meeting. Over years. You push, you lose, you count, you push again."

They walked. Enzo carried the folio. The weight of it was nothing. The weight of the morning was something else — the carved lion, the open book of laws, the word that Contarini had spoken so easily, *agents*, as though death were simply another tool of governance, which on this island, in this republic, it was.

"You did well," Bardolino said. "You sat, you watched, you kept quiet. Half the apprentices I've brought fidgeted like they had ants in their hose." He clapped Enzo's shoulder. His hand was warm through the cloth. "Next year maybe you carry the mariegola to the lectern. The clerk is getting old. They'll need someone with steady hands."

The fondamenta narrowed. Ahead, the furnace chimney drew its constant line against the sky. Bardolino walked toward it with the same proprietary stride he'd carried into the palazzo, and Enzo walked beside him, half a step behind, the folio against his ribs in the same place where, six nights ago, he had held a dead man's manuscript, and the morning sun fell on both of them equally, on the maestro's broad back and on the yellow circle stitched to Enzo's chest, and neither of them spoke of the thing that lay between them, which was the distance between what a man showed the world and what he kept locked in a room at the back of his workshop.
