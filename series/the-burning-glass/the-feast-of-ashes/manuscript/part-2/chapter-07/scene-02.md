The oratory smelled of tallow and old paper. Enzo stood in the doorway until his eyes adjusted — the single window faced north into a courtyard wall, and the light that entered was thin, already used. Rabbi Yehudah sat at the study table with a codex open before him, one long finger tracing a line of Hebrew, his lips moving without sound. He did not look up, but he said, "Enzo," and the boy crossed the threshold.

The room had been a storeroom once. You could see it in the iron hooks still set into the ceiling beams, in the wear pattern on the stone floor where barrels had stood. Now it held the study table, a cabinet for the Torah scroll, a bench along the east wall, and a shelf of books that represented, Enzo knew, a fortune the community could not afford to lose. The mezuzah on the doorframe was the oldest on the street — Rabbi Yehudah had carried it from Padua forty years ago, wrapped in linen, pressed against his chest the way a man carries a child.

"Sit," the Rabbi said.

Enzo sat on the bench. He had not planned what to say. On the walk from Murano — the traghetto across the northern lagoon, then south through Cannaregio along the familiar calli where Judeo-Italian mixed with Venetian in the mouths of children playing in a doorway — he had rehearsed nothing. The guild meeting sat in his chest like undigested bread. Bardolino's voice, the notary's pen, the word *agents* — all of it pressed against the thing he carried, which was not the folio now but the shape of a question he could not ask anyone.

Rabbi Yehudah closed the codex. His fingers were ink-stained, the nails trimmed short, the joints swollen at the knuckles in the way of old scribes. He folded his hands and looked at Enzo with the patience of a man who had learned that silence was a form of invitation.

"I wanted to ask about my father," Enzo said.

The Rabbi's eyes — brown, clear, set deep beneath white brows — rested on him. "Your father."

"His last months. Before the accident." The word tasted wrong. It always did. "You saw him. At services. At study."

"I saw him."

"Was he —" Enzo stopped. He did not know the shape of the question. Was he afraid? Was he different? Was he carrying something? "Was he troubled?"

Rabbi Yehudah unfolded his hands and placed them flat on the table, a gesture Enzo had seen a hundred times, the gesture that meant a man was preparing to speak carefully. "Your father was a serious man, Enzo. He was always troubled, in the way that serious men are troubled. He thought about his work. He thought about you. He thought about the precariousness of a Jewish craftsman's position in a Christian furnace." A pause. "These are not new troubles."

"But was there something new? In those last months?"

The Rabbi tilted his head. The white beard moved against the dark fabric of his robe. "Why do you ask now? It has been eight months."

"Because I am in the furnace now. I stand where he stood. And I want to understand what he saw from there."

It was more than Enzo had intended to say, and it was also less. He rubbed his thumb across his left fingertips — the roughened pads where the grinding wheel had built its calluses — and waited.

Rabbi Yehudah studied him. Then he reached for a clay cup that sat at the edge of the table, drank from it, set it down. Water, not wine. The Rabbi drank only water during study hours.

"Your father came to me in Adar — February, March, your last winter together. He did not come for counsel. He came for study. He wanted to read Kohelet."

"Ecclesiastes?"

"He had not opened it since his own bar mitzvah. Twenty years. He sat where you are sitting and read it in Hebrew, slowly, stumbling over words he had once known. I did not ask why. A man who returns to Kohelet is a man who is measuring the distance between what he has built and what will remain." Rabbi Yehudah paused. "I let him read. We spoke about the verses afterward. He was interested in one passage in particular. *Ein kol chadash tachat ha-shemesh.* There is nothing new under the sun."

Enzo felt the words settle into him the way cold settles into stone — not all at once, but starting from the surface and working inward. His father, sitting on this bench, reading the same words about futility that generations of tired men had read before him.

"Did he say why?"

"He said a craftsman spends his life believing he is making something new. Then one day he sees that everything he has made was made before, by other hands, for other purposes." The Rabbi's voice was quiet, precise, each word placed like a stone in a wall. "I told him this was not what Kohelet meant. Kohelet is not about craft. It is about wisdom — the recognition that wisdom itself cannot save you from death, from chance, from the turning of the world. Your father listened. He did not argue. He came back twice more, read more chapters, then stopped coming."

"When did he stop?"

"A month before he died."

The room was quiet. From the courtyard, the sound of a woman calling a child's name — *Rivka, Rivka* — and then the quick slap of bare feet on stone. Enzo looked at the hooks in the ceiling. Meat hooks, probably. Or hooks for hanging herbs to dry. Repurposed now to hold a lamp on Friday evenings, when the oratory filled with the community's prayers and the smell of oil and wool and bodies pressed together in a room built for storing goods, not for speaking to God.

"Rabbi," he said. "Did my father ever speak to you about — about his work? About what he was making?"

Rabbi Yehudah's gaze sharpened. Not much. A degree, perhaps, the way a lens focuses light by the smallest adjustment. "Your father did not discuss the furnace with me. He understood, as you must understand, that a Jewish craftsman's position depends on trust. The furnace's secrets belong to the furnace."

The words landed precisely where the Rabbi intended them. Enzo heard the instruction beneath the statement and felt heat rise along the back of his neck.

"I was not asking about secrets."

"No?" The Rabbi let the syllable hang. Then his expression softened, and he leaned back in his chair — an old chair, the wood dark with use, the joints visible where a carpenter had fitted them without nails. "Let me tell you something. Not about your father. About a different craftsman.

"There was a builder in a city — it does not matter which city — who was given a plot of land by a great lord. 'Build me a house,' the lord said, 'the finest house in the city, and I will pay you well, and people will see your work and know your name.' The builder agreed. He spent a year on the house. He carved the lintels himself. He laid the floors with stone he carried from the mountains on his own back. He fitted the windows so the light entered in the morning and did not enter in the afternoon, so the rooms were bright when a man woke and cool when a man rested. It was, by any measure, a beautiful house."

Rabbi Yehudah paused. He touched the edge of his codex with one finger, a habit — the way another man might touch a talisman.

"When the house was finished, a neighbor came forward. He produced a deed. The land, he said, was his. The great lord had given away what did not belong to him. The builder protested — he had built in good faith, with his own hands, with his own stone. But the law was clear. The house stood on another man's land. Everything the builder had made belonged to the man who owned the ground beneath it."

Enzo waited. He expected a moral, a lesson, the turn that Talmudic stories always took — the resolution that made the parable into a teaching. But Rabbi Yehudah only looked at him.

"What happened to the builder?" Enzo asked.

"That depends on which tractate you read. In one version he tears the house down and carries the stones away. In another he accepts payment for his labor and walks away with nothing he built. In a third —" The Rabbi stopped. He picked up his clay cup, looked into it, set it down again. "In a third, he keeps living in the house and pretends he never heard about the deed. Until the owner comes to collect."

The courtyard had gone quiet. The child named Rivka had been caught, or had stopped running. Somewhere in the quarter, someone was frying fish — the smell came through the window like a hand laid on Enzo's shoulder, the smell of every Friday afternoon of his childhood, the smell of a life that proceeded by ancient rhythms regardless of what any lord or builder or craftsman decided.

"The community is uneasy," Rabbi Yehudah said, as if they had been discussing this all along. "You have heard the rumors. The French king moves south. If Naples falls — when Naples falls — Venice will have to choose. And when Christians must choose, they look for someone to blame for the cost of choosing. This is not new. Your father knew it. His father knew it."

*Ein kol chadash tachat ha-shemesh.*

"What should we do?" Enzo asked.

"We should do what we have always done. Study. Pray. Keep our heads below the line of sight. Make ourselves necessary and invisible at the same time." The Rabbi's mouth moved — not quite a smile, but the architecture of one, the place where humor lived in a face that had learned to contain it. "It is a difficult trick. Your father was good at it."

Enzo stood. The bench scraped against the stone floor. He wanted to say something — about the parable, about the builder, about the third version in which a man lives in a house that is not his and waits for the owner to come — but the words would not form into anything he could offer without revealing what lay behind them.

"Thank you, Rabbi."

"Enzo." The old man's voice caught him at the door. "The builder in the story. You asked what happened to him. But you did not ask the right question."

Enzo turned. "What is the right question?"

"Who owned the land." Rabbi Yehudah opened his codex again. "That is always the right question."

Enzo stepped into the calle. The light hit him — late morning, the sun high enough now to clear the tenement roofs and fall straight down into the narrow passage. He stood in it for a moment, blinking, the yellow circle on his chest bright as a coin. From inside the oratory, the sound of the Rabbi turning a page. From the end of the street, the smell of frying oil. And beneath his feet, the stones of a city that belonged to someone else, that had always belonged to someone else, worn smooth by the passage of people who lived on them and did not own them and went on living anyway.
