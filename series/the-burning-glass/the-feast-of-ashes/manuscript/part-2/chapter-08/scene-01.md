The fish were wrong.

Enzo saw it from ten paces — the mullet laid out on the marble slab had clouded eyes and flesh that held the thumbprint when the fishmonger pressed it for a customer. A day old at least, maybe two, iced and salted to disguise the slack. The fishmonger was talking fast, hands moving, quoting a price that belonged to a fresher catch. The customer, a cook by her stained apron, leaned in and sniffed. She walked away. The fishmonger called after her, dropped his price by a third, then turned to the next body in the crowd and started again.

Enzo moved past. He had no business with fish. Bardolino's list sat folded in his belt pouch: soda ash from the Levant, a particular grade. Manganese from Piedmont. Iron filings. Borax. And a secondary errand — pricing polishing compound from the German traders at the Fondaco, though Bardolino expected to be cheated and wanted Enzo's eyes on the quoted weights.

The Rialto at midmorning was a throat that swallowed everything. Bodies pressed through the Erberia — servants and cooks and friars and foreign sailors with their shirts unlaced, all of them shouldering past the stalls where cabbages were stacked in green walls and onions hung in braids from the crossbeams. The smell was layered: brine and blood from the Pescheria to the north, then pepper and cinnamon from the spice merchants in their locked wooden stalls, then the sweet rot of fruit going soft in the heat, then the human smell beneath it all — wool and sweat and the pomade the bankers used in their hair. A porter carrying a crate of live crabs on his shoulder swung wide to pass Enzo, eyes flicking to the yellow circle on his doublet, and gave himself an extra foot of clearance. Enzo did not adjust his stride.

He crossed toward the bridge. The Grand Canal below was packed with boats — barges heavy with timber from the mainland, gondolas threading between them, a peàta loaded with barrels of wine from the Veneto listing slightly to port. On the bridge itself, the crowd thickened to the point of contact, bodies against bodies, and Enzo kept his hand over his belt pouch and his elbows tight as he pushed through. The shops built along the bridge's length spilled their goods into the walkway — leather, ribbons, cheap devotional prints. A money changer sat at a table no wider than a man's arm span, his scales and his coins and his ledger arranged with a precision Enzo recognized. The precision of someone whose hands were his trade.

He found the soda ash merchant on the eastern bank, a Saracen with a permanent stall and a nephew who did the weighing. The price was fair. Enzo watched the nephew work the scales, checked the tare weight with a blank pan, and counted out Bardolino's coin. The soda ash went into a canvas sack that Enzo slung across his back. The manganese dealer was two stalls down. Same ritual — watch the scales, count the coin.

It was at the glassware stall near the foot of the bridge that the morning changed shape.

Enzo stopped there out of habit. Old Moretto kept a table of finished Murano pieces for sale to foreigners — drinking glasses, small mirrors, a few beads in millefiori. Nothing from Bardolino's furnace. Enzo picked up a goblet and held it to the light, rotating it between his thumb and two fingers. The stem had a twist in it — not decorative, accidental. A torsion introduced during the pull. The bowl was uneven at the rim, thicker on one side by a visible degree. Second-rate work. He set it down.

"You hold it like a man who has made one."

The voice came from his left. Accented — the vowels shaped differently, the consonants precise in the way of someone who had learned Venetian rather than been born into it. Enzo turned.

The man was examining a small standing mirror from Moretto's table, tilting it to catch the light as Enzo had just done with the goblet. He was taller than Enzo by half a head, perhaps thirty, with black hair cut short in the Western fashion and a close-trimmed beard that followed the line of his jaw. His doublet was good wool, dyed a deep brown — not wealthy, not poor, the dress of a merchant doing well enough to replace his clothes before they wore through. A rosary hung at his belt. His eyes were dark and warm, and when he smiled, which he did now, the skin at their corners creased in a way that suggested he did it often and meant it.

"I grind lenses," Enzo said. "I have not blown glass."

"Lenses." The man set the mirror down with care — not the way a customer sets down merchandise he does not want, but the way someone sets down an object he respects. "Then you know optics. You understand curvature and clarity. And you picked up that goblet and turned it the way a man reads a page — looking for the errors."

That was exactly what Enzo had been doing. He felt the small flare in his chest that came when someone saw a thing correctly.

"The stem is twisted," Enzo said. "And the rim is uneven. It would spill at one point before the others."

"Precisely." The man picked up another goblet from the table — a better one, from a different furnace. He held it up. His fingers were long and sure, the grip easy, though Enzo noticed the calluses on his right hand sat in odd places — not a craftsman's calluses, not a scribe's, something else. "Now this one. What do you see?"

Enzo took it. He held it to the light. The glass was clear, almost without color — good cristallo, well-purified. The walls were even. The stem was clean. But there was a flaw — a single trapped bubble, no bigger than a lentil, caught in the base where the stem met the bowl.

"Seed," Enzo said. "In the join. The gaffer reheated the stem attachment and didn't work the bubble out."

The man laughed. Not a polite laugh — a real one, with air in it. "You see it. Most buyers would never see it. They hold the glass up, they admire the clarity, they turn it in the light, and they pay full price for a piece with a weakness built into its center." He extended his hand. "Carlo Rossetti. I trade in Murano glass — or I am trying to. I am from the Levant, most recently Ragusa, and I am learning that buying well requires knowing more than I thought."

Enzo clasped his hand. The grip was firm and brief. "Enzo."

"Just Enzo?"

"Enzo Sforno."

Rossetti's eyes moved to the yellow circle on Enzo's doublet — a glance, no more, the way a man notes the color of a shirt or the cut of a cloak. His expression did not change. He looked back at Enzo's face with the same easy warmth.

"Enzo Sforno who grinds lenses and reads goblets like scripture. Which furnace?"

"Bardolino."

"I know the name. Good cristallo. Very pure." Rossetti leaned against the edge of Moretto's stall and crossed his arms. "I have been buying from Moretto here for three weeks, and from Gasparini on the Fondamenta, and I have a warehouse in Ragusa that I am trying to fill with pieces that will survive the voyage and impress the buyers at the other end. But I am —" He paused, smiled, searched for the word with a small circular gesture of his hand. "I am tired of buying blind. I can taste good wine, but I cannot tell you which hillside grew the grapes. You follow me?"

"You want to see a furnace."

"I want to see a furnace." Rossetti uncrossed his arms and spread his hands, palms up — a merchant's gesture of openness that had the practiced ease of something done a thousand times and the warmth of something meant every one of them. "I want to see the melt. I want to understand why one house makes cristallo that rings when you tap it and another makes glass that sounds dead. I want to know what I am buying." He tilted his head. "Is that an unreasonable thing to want?"

It was not. It was, in fact, the only reasonable thing a serious buyer could want. Enzo had watched merchants come to Bardolino's showroom and choose pieces by color and shape alone, the way a child picks fruit — by what looks brightest. A man who wanted to understand the craft, who could already spot a seed and knew the word for it, was something else.

But furnaces were closed to outsiders. The Consiglio dei Dieci enforced it, and the guild enforced it harder. Murano's secrets stayed on the island. Every apprentice learned this before he learned to hold a pontil.

"Bardolino does not take visitors," Enzo said.

"Of course." Rossetti nodded. No disappointment in his face — or if there was, he carried it lightly. "I understand. The secrets of the art. I would not ask you to break a confidence." He reached into the sack at his belt and produced a dried fig, bit it in half, and offered the other half to Enzo with the naturalness of a man sharing bread. Enzo took it. It was sweet, resinous, the flesh dark and dense. Levantine. Better than what the market sold.

"But perhaps," Rossetti said, chewing, "you could ask. Only ask. If your master Bardolino would permit a buyer — a serious buyer, not a tourist — to see the showroom, to speak with him about a large order, I would consider that a great favor. And I would not forget it."

He said it simply. No pressure in the words, no insistence. A request made and released, like a line cast into water.

Enzo swallowed the last of the fig. The sweetness sat on his tongue.

"I will ask," he said.

"That is all I can ask." Rossetti smiled again — the full smile, the one that reached his eyes and made the creases deepen. He reached into his doublet and produced a small card, printed, with his name and a Rialto address. "I am at the Fondaco for another month at least. Send word there, or come yourself. I will be delighted either way."

Enzo took the card. The printing was clean, the ink good. He tucked it into his belt pouch beside Bardolino's remaining coin.

"The fig was from Smyrna," Rossetti said, as if offering one last piece of information, a gift for the road. "The best figs in the world come from Smyrna. I will bring you a box of them when I come to the furnace." He raised a hand in farewell, turned, and moved into the crowd with the ease of a man who knew how to pass through tight spaces without touching anyone — fluid, unhurried, gone.

Enzo stood at Moretto's stall for a moment. The card in his pouch had a weight that was only paper. The soda ash pulled at his shoulder. Around him the market roared on — a vendor shouting the price of saffron like a man calling for help, a German in a broad hat arguing with a banker over exchange rates, two boys chasing a cat between the stalls. The Grand Canal glittered through the gaps in the crowd, and the wooden bridge groaned softly under its cargo of feet.

He had come to the Rialto to buy manganese and soda ash. He was leaving with those, and also with a name — Carlo Rossetti — and a promise he had made easily and now carried like a new coin in his pocket, small and definite, not yet spent. He shifted the sack on his shoulder and walked toward the boat landing. The sun sat on the water in white shards, and Enzo squinted against it, and went on.
