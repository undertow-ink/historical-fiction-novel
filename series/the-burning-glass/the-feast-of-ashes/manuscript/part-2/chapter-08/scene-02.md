Three weeks after Carlo Rossetti's visit, Enzo stood at the fish market weighing a choice between two baskets of sand.

The sand came from the Ticino river — fine, pale, washed three times according to the seller, a hunched Paduan with ink-stained fingers who also traded in ledger paper. Bardolino wanted four pounds for a crucible test. The first basket held coarser grain, visible crystals catching the late morning light. The second was finer, almost powdery, and cost six soldi more.

Enzo pinched a sample from each basket and rubbed the grains between his thumb and forefinger. The coarser sand had impurities he could feel — tiny shells, maybe calcium, the kind of contamination that would cloud a melt. The finer sand dissolved against his skin like salt.

"The second," he said.

The Paduan nodded and began measuring. Enzo watched his hands on the scale, the brass pans tipping and steadying, and behind the man's shoulder the Rialto bridge rose in its long wooden arc, heavy with foot traffic. Carts crossed in both directions. A woman with a basket of lemons on her head navigated between two porters carrying a rolled carpet. The bridge creaked — it always creaked, a sound so constant it became silence — and the morning moved at its ordinary pace.

He heard the change before he understood it.

It came from the direction of the Molo, carried on the voices of men walking fast. Not shouting. Not yet. But the register had shifted — the way a furnace changes pitch when the airflow alters, when someone opens a door that should have stayed shut. Enzo looked up from the scale. The Paduan looked up too.

A cluster of men came through the fish market from the east, not running but moving with the tight-shouldered purpose of men carrying news they needed to deliver before it spoiled. They wore the dark cloaks of the Rialto's professional class — factors, brokers, the men who stood between merchants and money. One of them stopped at a banker's table twenty paces from where Enzo stood.

The banker — a stout Venetian with a ledger the size of a Bible open before him — leaned forward. The broker spoke. Enzo could not hear the words. He did not need to. The banker's hands moved to his coin stacks and covered them, a gesture so automatic it looked rehearsed.

Then the word reached him, passed mouth to mouth through the fish sellers and the women buying eels and the German cloth merchant who had been arguing about the exchange rate on Rhenish florins.

France. The French king had crossed the Alps.

It moved through the market the way heat moves through glass — not all at once but in a wave, the leading edge invisible until it reached you. A fishmonger two stalls down set his knife on the cutting board and wiped his hands on his apron. He did not pick the knife back up. A boy who had been sorting mussels into baskets stood and stared toward the bridge as though he might see an army coming across it.

Enzo's hand went to the pouch at his belt where he kept Bardolino's money. The leather was warm from his body. He pressed his thumb across the roughened pads of his left fingers and felt the familiar ridges, the scars from grinding.

The Paduan sand merchant was talking to his neighbor. "Charles. Twenty thousand men. Maybe more. They say he crossed at Montgenevre."

"When?"

"A week ago. The dispatches came this morning."

A week. The French had been on Italian soil for seven days and Enzo had spent those days grinding lenses, eating bread, sleeping. The world had cracked and he had not felt it.

Around him the Rialto was doing what the Rialto did. It was adjusting. A fish seller pulled out his slate and rubbed away a price with his thumb, chalked a new one. Higher. The eels that had been eight soldi were now ten. At the spice merchant's stall, a factor was already recalculating — Enzo could see him working an abacus with sharp, percussive clicks, his lips moving. Pepper from Alexandria. Cinnamon from the Levant. Every trade route that passed within reach of a French army or a French fleet was repricing itself, and the men of the Rialto were doing the arithmetic before the Council of Ten had posted a single edict.

This was the thing itself. Not the palaces, not the Doge in his corno, not the gilt mosaics of San Marco. This. Men with slates and abacuses and the nerve to recalculate before the ink on the dispatches had dried. The Republic was a machine, and its gears were here — in the fish market, at the bankers' tables, in the holds of galleys not yet recalled from Cyprus and Crete.

Enzo stood holding his bag of sand and felt the crowd thicken around him. More men arriving from the Molo, from the Fondaco dei Tedeschi where the German merchants would be in a fury of speculation. A knot of traders blocked the alley between two stalls and he pressed himself against a column to let them pass. One of them glanced at him — at his chest, at the yellow circle sewn to his doublet — and looked away. The glance lasted less than a breath. It said nothing. It did not need to.

*When Christians must choose, they look for someone to blame.*

Rabbi Yehudah's voice came to him whole, not as memory but as presence, as though the old man stood at his shoulder. The Rabbi had said it in his study on a quiet afternoon with dust floating in the light from the window, and Enzo had nodded the way a boy nods at warnings he cannot yet feel. He felt it now. The yellow circle on his chest was a small sun that did not warm.

He paid the Paduan for the sand. The man counted the coins twice — he had already adjusted to the new arithmetic of a world at war, checking each coin's weight with his thumb as though the silver might have thinned overnight. Enzo took the bag and moved toward the bridge.

The bridge was slower now. Men stood in clusters along the railings, talking. A public crier had appeared at the eastern end, reading from a scroll — the Council's first response, delivered with the speed that made Venice Venice. Enzo caught fragments as he pushed through. Galleys recalled. The ambassador to Milan summoned. Citizens counseled to maintain order and trust in the wisdom of the Senate.

Trust. The word hung in the salt air like smoke.

He stopped midway across the bridge. Below, the Grand Canal moved as it always moved, green-brown and indifferent, carrying barges and gondolas and the reflected light of palaces. A salt barge passed beneath him, low in the water, its cargo worth more today than it had been worth yesterday. Everything was worth more today. Everything was more dangerous.

The bag of sand pressed against his hip. Four pounds of Ticino river sand, washed three times, fine enough to melt into glass so clear you could read through it. Glass for lenses. Lenses that could gather light. Light that could burn.

The crates in Bardolino's storeroom.

He did not think the thought through to its end. He did not need to. It arrived the way heat arrived through the wall of a crucible — not as idea but as sensation, a spreading warmth beneath his sternum that was not warmth but recognition. The Republic was a machine. The machine needed things. Men in dark cloaks calculated the cost of pepper and the price of galleys and the value of weapons that did not yet exist, and somewhere in that calculation was a furnace on Murano and a master who worked late and a storeroom with crates that no apprentice was meant to open.

Enzo walked. The bridge deposited him on the San Marco side and he turned north toward the traghetto that would carry him back to Murano. The afternoon light lay flat on the water, pale gold, the kind of light that in the furnace would mean the fire was banked and cooling. But this fire was not cooling. This fire was just lit.

He carried the sand against his ribs. Around him Venice moved and calculated and adjusted, and the men at the Rialto were already building the new world out of numbers and nerve, and Enzo Sforno walked among them with four pounds of fine river sand and the knowledge — partial, pressing, shaped like a lens he could not yet hold up to the light — that the furnace where he ground his glass was part of the machine too.

The traghetto rocked when he stepped in. He sat on the bench, the bag in his lap, and watched Venice recede across the water. The city looked the same. The domes, the towers, the wooden teeth of the mooring poles. But a furnace looked the same too, whether you were melting sand into window glass or shaping something that could set a ship on fire at four hundred paces.

It was what burned inside that mattered.
