Enzo smelled the Contarini furnace before he reached it — clean heat, no char, the fire of a house that could afford good wood. He had come to return a grinding disc his master had borrowed three months ago and never sent back. Bardolino had not asked him to return it. Enzo had decided this himself, and he did not look too closely at why.

The fondamenta was loud with morning work. Carts of silica and soda ash lined the canal side, and two boys hauled a crate of finished goblets toward a waiting boat. The Contarini operation had a rhythm to it that Bardolino's lacked — the steady pulse of a furnace that knew what it was making and for whom.

He found Serena in the counting room beside the main workshop, a narrow space with a single window that faced the canal. She sat on a stool behind a table covered in ledgers, her sleeves pushed past her elbows, a quill behind her ear. A strand of dark auburn hair had come loose from its braid and hung along her jaw. She did not look up when he entered.

"You can leave it by the door," she said.

"Leave what?"

"Whatever you're delivering. My father's in the workshop."

"I'm not delivering. I'm returning." He held up the grinding disc. "Your father lent this to Maestro Bardolino."

Now she looked up. Her eyes were the color of lagoon water where the shallows met the deep — not quite green, not quite brown, changeable with the light. She had freckles across the bridge of her nose, more than he remembered.

"Three months ago," she said.

"You know about it?"

"I know about everything that leaves this furnace and how long it stays gone." She took the disc from him, turned it in her hands, checked the edge for chips. Her fingers were calloused at the tips, the nails cut short. She set it on the table beside her ledger. "It's not damaged. That's something."

"We're careful with borrowed tools."

"You are. I don't know about the rest of them." She said it without malice, a statement of fact delivered the way a trader states a price. She pulled the quill from behind her ear and made a note in the margin of her ledger. "Grinding disc, returned, February. I'll tell my father."

Enzo should have left. The errand was done. But the room held him — the ordered rows of numbers visible on the open page, the stack of ledgers on the shelf behind her, the quiet industry of it. Serena worked the way he worked: with her whole attention, the world narrowed to the task.

"You keep the accounts?" he said.

"Someone has to. My father can make glass that would stop your heart, but if you ask him what he paid for manganese last month, he'll tell you a story about his grandfather." She turned the ledger toward him, not quite an invitation but not a refusal either. "Sit down if you're going to stand there staring."

He sat on the stool across from her. The ledger was bound in brown leather, soft with handling, the pages dense with columns of figures in Serena's neat hand. Dates, quantities, prices, suppliers. She had organized it by material — one section for silica, another for soda ash, another for colorants, another for fuel. Each entry was cross-referenced to a furnace run and a finished product.

"This is —" He stopped, not sure what word he wanted.

"Thorough?" she offered. "Obsessive? My father says obsessive."

"Precise." He traced a column with his finger, careful not to smudge the ink. The numbers told a story if you knew how to read them. He knew glass the way his hands knew it — the weight, the heat, the moment a gather was ready to shape. But this was glass from the other side. The bones beneath the skin.

"You can see the whole market in here," Serena said. She leaned forward, and he caught a faint scent — not perfume but something warmer, soap and wool and the ever-present trace of furnace smoke that lived in every Muranese. At this distance the freckles across her nose were distinct, each one separate, like the stippling of iron oxide in a batch of raw silica. She turned back several pages. "Look. Soda ash prices from the Levant, last six months." Her finger moved down the column. "Steady through summer. Then September — up a third. October, up again. By December, nearly double."

"The French," Enzo said. "The invasion routes cut the overland trade."

"Partly. But look here." She flipped to another section. "Manganese from Piedmont. Same period. Stable. Because manganese doesn't come through the same channels." She looked at him, and her expression had the focus he recognized from his own work — the narrowed attention of someone reading a pattern no one else had bothered to trace. "Everyone talks about the war as if it's one thing. One disaster. But it hits each material differently, each supply line at different times. If you're watching, you can see it coming. Weeks before the prices move on the Rialto, you can see it in the orders."

"Your father uses this?"

"My father listens when I tell him to buy. He doesn't always ask why." The dimple in her left cheek appeared and vanished. "He's a better glassmaker for it. He just doesn't know that's what I'm doing."

Enzo looked at the ledger with new eyes. What Serena had built was not merely a record of purchases. It was a map. She tracked not just the Contarini furnace but the furnaces around it — who was buying what, in what quantities, and when. She read the shifts in their orders the way he read the shift of light through a curved lens. Distortion revealed truth.

"You track the other furnaces," he said.

"I track what I can see. Who's taking deliveries, who's stopped. Which boats come to which docks." She shrugged, but her eyes held steady on his. "It's not difficult. You just have to pay attention. Most people don't."

"Most people can't."

She looked at him for a moment, her head tilted slightly, as if he had said something in a language she was still deciding whether to trust. Then she turned to a page near the back of the ledger. The entries here were sparser, written in a smaller hand. Estimates, not records. Guesses made with care.

"Venier's furnace dropped two workers in November," she said. "They're making less cristallo and more common glass. That means they're chasing volume because they can't hold margins. Garzoni took on a new apprentice but hasn't increased their silica orders — so they're stretching what they have. Trevisan is buying colorants he's never bought before, which means he's trying something new, which means he's worried the old work isn't selling."

She closed the ledger and rested her hand on its cover. Her fingers were ink-stained at the edges, the nails trimmed to the quick so they wouldn't catch on the pages. Working hands. Like his.

"And Bardolino?" Enzo asked. He kept his voice level.

Serena met his gaze. The humor drained from her face — not cruelty in its place, but a kind of care, the gentleness of someone about to set a bone.

"Your maestro hasn't paid his soda ash supplier in two months. His fuel deliveries have dropped by a third. He's running fewer melts but keeping the same number of workers, which means he's burning through his reserves to meet wages." She paused. "Everyone on Murano knows, Enzo. The boats talk. The suppliers talk."

His hands were flat on the table. He looked at them rather than at her.

"Your maestro is desperate," Serena said. "Desperate men make desperate choices."

The words dropped into him like a stone into still water, and he felt the rings spread outward, touching everything. The storeroom. The locked door. The shapes beneath the canvas that were not glass vessels. He had told no one. He had not even told himself the full truth of what he had seen, because telling himself would make it a thing that required action, and he did not know what action to take.

He could tell her. The thought formed and he felt its pull — the relief of shared weight, the hunger to be known by someone who would understand. Serena, of all people, would see the pattern. She would know what Bardolino's desperation had driven him to.

But the words would not come. Not because he did not trust her. Because once he said it aloud, it would become real in a way he could not undo. And because the knowledge was dangerous — not just for him but for anyone who held it. He would not put that in her hands. Not hers.

"He's a good glassmaker," Enzo said. It was not a defense. It was the truest thing he could offer without offering the rest.

"I know he is." Serena's voice was quieter now. "That's what makes it worse."

The canal light moved across the wall behind her, a slow ripple of reflected sun that turned the plaster briefly gold. She gathered the quill from where it had rolled and tucked it back behind her ear.

"You should come again," she said. "When you need to return something else that's been gone three months."

"You'll be here?"

"Where else?" She gestured at the ledgers, the table, the small ordered kingdom she had built inside her father's furnace. "Someone has to count the manganese."

He stood. At the door he turned back. She was already writing again, her head bent over the ledger, the loose strand of hair falling forward across her cheek. She did not brush it away. Her hand moved steadily across the page, recording what she saw, making the invisible visible, the way good glass did. The way all true craft did.

He carried her words with him back along the fondamenta, past the furnaces with their plumes of smoke and their secrets. *Desperate men make desperate choices.* She had given him nothing he did not already know. That was what made it unbearable. The truth had been there all along, waiting in the numbers, in the dwindling deliveries, in the locked storeroom door. Serena had merely held up the lens.

The light on the canal was sharp and clear, the kind of winter light that hid nothing.
