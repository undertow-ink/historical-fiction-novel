Bardolino had sent the apprentices home an hour early. He told them the furnace needed resting — a lie so transparent that young Marco had glanced at Sandro before gathering his tools, and Sandro had not glanced back, which was worse. They knew something. They did not know what. Bardolino preferred it that way, though he understood that preference was itself a kind of cowardice, the cowardice of a man who locks a door and then pretends the room behind it does not exist.

He stood now at the workbench in the main hall, arranging things that did not need arranging. The furnace breathed low behind its iron doors, banked for the night but never fully sleeping — no glassmaker's furnace ever fully slept, not if its master wanted to find it alive come morning. The orange light pulsed against the soot-darkened walls in a rhythm Bardolino had known longer than he had known his own heartbeat, and he let it steady him the way it always had. Fire was honest. Fire did what it did. You could not argue with it or flatter it or deceive it, and in return it would not deceive you.

He was not, he told himself, afraid.

The millefiori piece turned between his thumb and forefinger inside his trouser pocket, its edges worn smooth by months of this precise motion. A little rod of fused cane, no longer than a finger joint — flowers of white and cobalt blue frozen in clear glass, cut from a piece his grandfather had pulled fifty years ago. He carried it the way other men carried rosaries. Tonight it was not enough.

The knock came at the courtyard door: three measured raps, then two quick. The signal Frate Silvestro had arranged. Bardolino dried his palms on his leather apron, then removed the apron, then put it back on because a glassmaker without his apron was a man pretending to be something other than what he was. He crossed the workshop floor, his bad hip catching on the second step the way it always did when the night air crept into the building, and lifted the bar.

Frate Silvestro stood in the courtyard with his hands folded inside his sleeves, his round face tight with an expression Bardolino recognized from years of parish life — the expression of a man performing an introduction he wished he did not have to make. Behind him, half-swallowed by the shadow of the archway, stood a figure in a Franciscan habit so stained and travel-worn it might have been cut from the canal mud itself.

"Maestro Bardolino," Silvestro said. "Fra Giordano da Padova."

The figure stepped forward into the furnace light, and Bardolino's first thought, God forgive him, was: *this is the man?*

He had expected — what? Something large. The diagrams that had arrived over the past months, rolled in oilskin and sealed with unmarked wax, had carried such authority, such sweeping confidence in their line and annotation, that Bardolino had imagined the hand that drew them as belonging to a substantial man, a man who filled a doorway. Fra Giordano da Padova did not fill a doorway. He was short, gaunt, sharp-boned as a bird dressed for the spit. His tonsure was ragged, the remaining hair dark and greying at the temples, and his hands — Bardolino looked at the hands first, as he always did — were small, ink-blackened, and in constant motion, the fingers working against each other as though shaping something invisible between them.

Then Giordano looked up, and Bardolino understood the diagrams.

The eyes. Dark, enormous in that narrow face, and bright with a heat that had nothing to do with fever and everything to do with a fire banked as deep and as permanent as the one behind the furnace doors. They moved across Bardolino's face, across the workshop, across the furnace mouth, the tools hung on the wall, the racks of cooling glass, and each thing they touched was assessed and understood and dismissed in the space of a breath. Bardolino had seen eyes like that exactly once before — old Maestro Rivelli, sixty years at the furnace, who could glance at a gather of molten glass and tell you its temperature within ten degrees. Eyes that consumed what they saw.

"The kiln is wood-fired," Giordano said, not as greeting but as observation, already moving past Bardolino into the workshop. His voice was higher than expected, rapid, with the clipped consonants of the Veneto hinterland. "Beechwood, from the smell. Good. Consistent heat. You cure the billets before burning? Of course you do. Friar Bacon specifies — but you would know that from the drawings. The annealing schedule, you followed it precisely? The differential cooling is essential. *Essentialissimum.* A lens that cools unevenly is a lens that lies."

"Fra Giordano," Bardolino said, because a man had to say something, and the friar was already at the furnace mouth, peering through the inspection port with the unselfconscious intensity of a child examining an anthill. "You are welcome. I trust the crossing from the mainland was —"

"Where are the lenses?"

Silvestro, still at the doorway, made a small sound — not quite a cough, not quite a word. An apology, or the ghost of one. Bardolino met his eyes and saw there what he had feared he would see: a good man's helplessness in the presence of a force he could not moderate. Silvestro had warned him, in the careful language of a friar who would not speak ill of a brother. *He is very devoted to his work. He is perhaps not always mindful of — courtesies.* That had been the word. Courtesies. Bardolino thought of a crucible that cracked in the annealing oven. A cracked pot leaks before it breaks, his father had said. But his father had been speaking of debts.

"This way," Bardolino said.

He led them through the main workshop, past the cold marver tables and the pipe racks, to the storeroom at the back. The door was oak, iron-banded, fitted with the new lock he had bought from a smith on the Rialto and installed himself so that no one in the furnace would see the locksmith come. He drew the key from inside his shirt where it hung on a cord against his sternum, warm with his own heat, and turned it in the lock. The tumblers fell with a sound like small bones settling.

Inside, the storeroom smelled of sawdust and linseed oil and the faintly metallic scent of ground glass. Three wooden crates sat on the workbench, each packed in straw. Bardolino opened the first.

The lens lay nested in linen, and even in the weak light of the single candle he had left burning here — another preparation he would not call fear — it gathered what illumination there was and held it. Two spans across, gently curved, its surface polished to a clarity that Bardolino knew, with the honest pride of a craftsman, was as fine as any glass ground in Christendom. He had spent eleven days on the polishing alone, working from Giordano's specifications with a precision that had cost him sleep and two apprentices' patience and the better part of his scepticism. The specifications had been extraordinary. No one made lenses like this. No one had asked for lenses like this.

Fra Giordano lifted it from the crate with both hands, and Bardolino saw his fingers stop their restless motion for the first time since he had entered the building.

"Oh," the friar said. A whisper. "*Oh.*"

He held the lens up to the candle flame, tilting it, and the light passed through and split into a ghostly rainbow that played across the far wall — red, gold, green, violet, sliding over the rough plaster like something living. Giordano's lips moved. Latin, Bardolino thought, though too quiet to distinguish — a prayer or a formula, and with this man perhaps there was no difference. The friar's face in the candlelight was transformed, the gauntness and the pockmarks and the fanatical energy all dissolved into something that could only be called worship, and despite everything he knew and feared, Bardolino felt the pull of it. He understood it. He had felt it himself, those nights alone at the bench with the grinding paste and the slowly clarifying glass, the sense of coaxing something perfect from something crude. Theory into substance. Thought into matter. It was what glassmaking was, at its root, and this strange, slight, terrifying friar understood that root as well as any man Bardolino had ever met.

"Maestro." Giordano's eyes had not left the lens. "This is — *Friar Bacon himself* — the curvature, you achieved the hyperbolic profile? Exactly as specified?"

"Within the tolerances your diagrams allowed. The glass resists perfection, Fra Giordano. It has its own ideas about what shape it wants to be."

"Yes, yes, but the focal convergence — if the curvature holds, and I believe it will, I *see* that it will — the calculations predict a focal intensity sufficient to ignite timber at half a mile." He said it the way Bardolino might have said *the batch will be ready by Tuesday.* A fact among facts. "A Venetian galley, Maestro. Imagine it. The deck, the rigging, the sails. At half a mile."

The storeroom was not cold. The furnace wall backed against it, and even through stone and brick, the heat radiated steadily. Yet something contracted in Bardolino's chest, a tightening that had nothing to do with temperature and everything to do with the friar's voice, which had not changed register or rhythm when it moved from optical theory to the burning of ships full of living men.

Silvestro was staring at the floor. His hands, folded inside his sleeves, gripped each other — Bardolino could see the knuckles shift beneath the wool.

"The device is theoretical," Bardolino said. His voice came out as he intended it: measured, hoarse, professionally cautious. "Your own correspondence acknowledges the atmospheric variables. Humidity. Refraction through sea air. Cloud cover."

"Obstacles to be refined, not refutations," Giordano said. He was holding the lens at arm's length now, sighting through it at the candle, one eye closed, the other — that burning, consuming eye — magnified grotesquely through the glass so that for one vertiginous moment it was all Bardolino could see: the dark iris, the dilated pupil, the absolute and annihilating certainty of a mind that had solved the equation and would not be told the answer was monstrous. "Bacon understood this three centuries ago. *Ignis per artem compositus* — fire composed through art. We are merely completing what he envisioned. The mathematics are not approximate, Maestro. They are precise."

*The fire will tell you,* Bardolino thought. And this fire was telling him. It was telling him what he had spent months refusing to hear — that the weapon he had dismissed as a theorist's fantasy was, in the hands of this theorist, something more. That the lenses he had ground with such care and such compromised pride were not curios or follies or the fever-dreams of a cloistered friar but instruments, designed with a rigour Bardolino recognized because it matched his own.

"I should like to see the remaining two lenses," Giordano said, already reaching for the second crate. "And we must discuss the mounting apparatus. Your ironworker — is he reliable? The armature must allow azimuthal rotation on two axes simultaneously, and the tolerances —"

He talked for another quarter of an hour. Bardolino answered what was asked of him and volunteered nothing more. Silvestro stood by the wall and said three words the entire time: "It grows late." A suggestion that Giordano received the way the furnace received a cup of water — with a brief hiss and no discernible effect.

When they finally left — Giordano still talking as he crossed the courtyard, Silvestro steering him gently by the elbow toward the canal path and San Donato — Bardolino stood in the storeroom doorway and watched the darkness seal behind them. The night air carried the distant lap of the lagoon against the fondamenta and the smell of salt and mud and the half-sweet decay that was Murano in autumn.

He stepped back inside. Closed the door. The three crates stood open on the workbench, the lenses gleaming dully in their linen beds, patient and mute as everything was mute that men made and then asked to speak for them.

He had told himself the weapon would not work. He had repeated it through the months of grinding and polishing, through the letter exchanges with Viaro, through the installation of the lock and the dismissal of the apprentices and the careful, layered construction of a lie he could live inside. It was a theorist's conceit. It was an old dream, Bacon's dream, revived by a clever friar who did not understand what glass could and could not do.

But the friar understood exactly what glass could do. That was the trouble. That was the fissure that had opened in the storeroom floor and that Bardolino could feel even now beneath his feet, the first true crack in the structure he had built to hold his conscience above the flood. Giordano had held the lens to the light and Bardolino had seen, in the rainbow that spilled across the wall, not beauty but proof. Proof that the mathematics worked. Proof that the curvature was right. Proof that somewhere at the end of the long chain of theory and craft and compromise and self-deception, a ship could burn.

The millefiori piece was in his hand. He did not remember drawing it from his pocket. He stood in the storeroom among his instruments of careful, deniable catastrophe, and he turned the small glass flowers over and over between his thumb and the stub where his fingertip had been, and he listened to the furnace breathe through the wall, and he did not pray, because he no longer knew what to ask for.
