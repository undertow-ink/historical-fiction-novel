Bardolino stood in the campo and let the night settle against his skin. The storeroom door was locked behind him, the friar gone, the lenses wrapped in their velvet and hidden where no casual hand would find them. The air off the canal carried salt and the vegetal rot of low tide, and after the close heat of the storeroom it felt like drinking cold water. He breathed it in. His hands were still trembling — a faint vibration in the fingers, the kind that came after too many hours at the furnace mouth, though he had not worked the furnace today. He pressed his palms flat against his thighs and held them there until the trembling stopped or until he could no longer feel it, which amounted to the same thing.

He walked north through the fondamenta, past the shuttered workshops and the dark houses where other men slept with their consciences arranged neatly beside them like shoes at a bedside. The rio reflected nothing. No moon tonight, only the low clouds that settled over the lagoon in winter and turned the sky into a ceiling of grey wool. His boots were loud on the stone. He had always been a loud walker — Alessandra used to say he moved through the world as if daring it to get out of his way, and she had not meant it as a compliment, though he had chosen to take it as one. That was seven years ago now. Eight. The fever had taken her in the humid August of 1491, and he had stood at her bedside and held her hand and understood for the first time that there were furnaces he could not tend, temperatures he could not control.

San Donato rose ahead of him, its brick campanile a darker column against the dark sky. The door was unlocked — it was always unlocked, the parish priest being either trusting or forgetful, and Bardolino had never cared to determine which. He pushed it open and stepped inside.

The silence here was of a different quality than the silence of the storeroom. That had been the silence of secrecy, of two men circling each other with careful words. This was the silence of stone that had absorbed five centuries of prayer and wore it like a patina. The nave stretched before him, the columns catching the faintest light from the votive candles that burned in their iron rack near the south transept. Six or seven flames, no more — the prayers of women who had come that afternoon to ask the Virgin for safe births, good harvests, husbands who would come home sober. Small prayers. Clean ones.

He did not genuflect. He should have, and he knew he should have, and the knowledge sat in him like a pebble in a boot — present, irritating, insufficiently painful to demand action. He walked down the nave instead, his boots echoing off the flagstones, and chose a pew near the front where the candlelight reached but did not illuminate. He sat. The wood was cold through his breeches. He placed his hands on his knees, those enormous scarred hands that had shaped ten thousand vessels and were admired across the lagoon, and he looked up at the apse.

The mosaic filled the conch above the altar. The Virgin stood against a field of gold, her dark robes falling in folds that the tesserae rendered with a precision that still, after all these years, arrested him. She held the Christ child and gazed out over the empty church with an expression that was not mercy and not judgment but something between the two — an attention so complete it felt like being weighed. The gold tesserae caught the votive light and held it, each tiny square tilted at its own angle by the hand of a craftsman dead eight hundred years, so that the surface shimmered and breathed and refused to be static. Glass and gold and stone. The finest work the human hand could do with a furnace and a kiln and the mineral gifts of the earth. This was what the craft was for.

Bardolino rubbed the stump of his left ring finger with his thumb. The old habit. He had lost the fingertip at twenty-three, a moment's carelessness with a pontello rod, and the scar had long since silvered over into something he touched the way other men touched rosary beads — not for comfort, exactly, but for confirmation. He was still here. The wound had healed. Things healed.

Enzo's face came to him then, and he let it come because resisting it would have required more effort than he had left tonight. The boy standing in the workshop doorway that afternoon, asking about the storeroom, and Bardolino hearing his own voice — deep, unhurried, avuncular — explaining that the special commission was glassware for a cardinal's table, nothing more, and watching the lie land in Enzo's dark eyes and take root there. The boy had believed him. Of course the boy had believed him. Enzo Sforno believed in his master the way young men believe in the structures that hold their world upright — not because he had examined the evidence but because the alternative was vertigo. And Bardolino had used that belief the way a glazier uses leading: to hold the separate pieces in place, to make the window hold.

The boy had his father's hands. That was the worst of it, or near enough to the worst that the distinction did not matter. The same long fingers, the same economy of movement, the same instinct for where the heat lived inside the glass and how to negotiate with it. Giacomo's hands, reproduced with the casual cruelty of inheritance on his son's wrists, working now on lenses that Giacomo himself had once ground in this same project, for these same men, before —

Before the accident.

Bardolino closed his eyes. Behind the lids, the votive flames persisted as orange ghosts.

Giacomo Sforno had come to see him three days before the explosion. A Tuesday — Bardolino remembered this because Alessandra's requiem mass was said on Tuesdays, and he had come from the church to the workshop and found Giacomo waiting for him by the annealing oven, sitting on an upturned crate with his hat in his hands. They had been friends for twenty years. They had drunk together, mourned together, stood as godfathers to each other's children. And Giacomo had sat on that crate and turned his hat in his hands and said, *Vittorio, I need to speak with you about what these lenses are actually for.*

Bardolino had told him to lower his voice.

Giacomo had not lowered his voice. He had looked up with those eyes that Enzo would inherit — the same dark intensity, the same stubborn clarity — and he had said, *I spoke to a man in the Arsenale. He described what they intend to build. This is not a curiosity, Vittorio. This is not philosophy. They mean to burn ships with this, and the men inside them.*

And Bardolino had said — what had he said? He had said the things he always said. That the design was theoretical. That the mathematics were impossible. That the Council funded dozens of such projects and none of them came to anything, and this one would join the rest in the drawer of discarded ambitions. He had said these things with the same deep, measured, avuncular voice he would later use on Enzo, because the voice was a tool and he knew how to use his tools, and Giacomo had listened and nodded and put his hat back on his head and left.

Three days later, the crucible in Giacomo's workshop cracked along a flaw line and the trapped steam blew the furnace open and Giacomo Sforno died with glass in his lungs.

The crucible cracked. These things happen. Bardolino had attended the funeral and wept genuine tears and taken Giacomo's son into his workshop as an apprentice because it was the right thing to do and because the guilt was already there, curled at the base of his throat like a coal that would not cool, and an act of generosity might — might — bank it down to something he could swallow around.

The crucible cracked.

A flaw in the silica. Insufficient annealing. The pressures of a firing that ran too hot. He had seen crucibles crack before. He had lost a week's work to a cracked crucible in the winter of 1487 and had cursed for an hour and poured himself wine and moved on, because these things happened and a man who worked with fire accepted that fire was not always obedient.

But Giacomo had been asking questions. Giacomo had spoken to a man in the Arsenale. And three days later Giacomo was dead, and the questions died with him, and the project continued, and no one — no one at all — had come to Bardolino's workshop to inspect the crucible or to ask how a vessel that had survived forty firings could crack on the forty-first.

He opened his eyes. The Virgin gazed down at him from her golden field, patient as geology, and the tesserae shimmered with a light that was not their own but that they held and multiplied and gave back transformed. That was the miracle of glass — it did not generate light but it could shape it, bend it, make it serve purposes the sun had never intended. A lens could magnify a letter on a page. A prism could split white light into its hidden colors. A mosaic could take the flicker of six small candles and turn a wall into heaven.

A lens could focus the sun into a point of fire that would burn a galley to the waterline.

His hand went to his pocket and found the millefiori piece there, smooth and warm from the heat of his thigh. He had made it at nineteen, his first successful piece — a tiny disc of fused cane slices, each one a flower rendered in glass no thicker than a fingernail, the colors still true after thirty-six years. He turned it between his fingers. Blue and white and the deep amber of Murano gold, set in a field of clear crystal. He had made it in the years when the craft was still an astonishment to him, when each firing revealed something he had not expected and each morning at the furnace mouth felt like a conversation with a god who spoke only in light and heat. Before his father's gambling debts. Before the creditors and the slow surrender of ambition to necessity. Before he had learned that a man could love his craft and still use it as a currency to purchase safety.

He should confess. The thought arrived with the mechanical regularity of a bell tower marking the hour — he should confess, he should kneel in the confessional and speak the words and receive the penance and walk out lighter. But confession required honesty, and Bardolino was not ready to be honest, not even with a priest who was bound by sacrament to forget what he heard. To confess he would have to say: *I believe Giacomo was murdered. I believe I am building a weapon that will work. I believe I have placed his son inside the same machine that killed his father.* And once those words existed in the air of this church, in the space beneath this mosaic, they could not be taken back. They would be true. They were already true. But there was a difference between a truth that lived in the unlit corridors of the mind and a truth that had been spoken aloud, and Bardolino was not yet ready to cross that threshold.

Not yet.

He stood. His knees ached — the cold of the pew, the cold of the stone floor radiating upward through his boots, the ordinary cold of a man who was fifty-five years old and had spent too many of those years standing before a furnace that warmed his face and left his back to freeze. He looked up once more at the Virgin. Her gaze had not changed. It would not change. That was the nature of mosaic, the permanence that fresco and paint could never achieve: each tessera fixed in its bed of mortar, each angle set, the image locked against time and decay and the slow entropy of human intention. She would still be here when he was ash. She would still be watching.

He walked back down the nave. He did not genuflect at the door, either. Outside, the night air wrapped around him again, and the clouds had not lifted, and the canal still reflected nothing, and the millefiori piece in his pocket was warm from his hand, warmer than when he had entered, as if it had absorbed something in the church that the church itself had not given him. He turned south toward his house, walking loudly over the stones, carrying what he carried.
