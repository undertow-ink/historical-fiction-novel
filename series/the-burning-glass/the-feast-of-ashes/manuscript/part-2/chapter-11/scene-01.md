The bow of the sandolo cut a line through water the color of wet slate, and Enzo kept one hand on the crated mirror to steady it against the rocking. October light came low across the lagoon, turning the surface to hammered tin where the wake spread behind them. Between his knees the crate rode the gentle pitch, wrapped in linen and then in wool, and he could feel through the wood the faint vibration of the hull against the chop.

Bardolino sat in the stern, one arm draped along the gunwale, watching the skyline of Venice resolve itself from haze into stone. He had dressed for the delivery: a dark green doublet with silver-thread closures, his beard trimmed close, his grey hair combed back and oiled. He looked, Enzo thought, like a man who belonged in rooms with marble floors. The boatman, a Muranese named Cecco who ferried glass shipments twice a week, worked the oar in silence.

"Keep your hand flat on it," Bardolino said without turning. "The bow drops when we cross another wake. Flat, not gripping. Let it move with you."

Enzo adjusted his hand. The linen wrapping was cool under his palm. Inside the crate, bedded in straw, the cristallo mirror waited — two palms wide, ground and polished to a clarity that had made Bardolino hold it up to the furnace light three times before he was satisfied. Enzo had done the final polish himself, working the pumice in smaller and smaller circles until the surface threw back a reflection so true it was like looking into still water. His fingertips still carried the ghost of that labor, the skin worn smooth in places where it was usually rough.

The campanile of San Marco stood above the roofline now, gold at its peak catching the morning. Enzo had been to Venice proper perhaps a dozen times in his four years on Murano, always on errands, always with the yellow circle stitched to his doublet marking him as clearly as a brand on a shipping crate. He touched it now without thinking — the wool patch his mother had sewn on, the edges beginning to fray. On Murano he could sometimes forget it. The furnace did not care what was sewn to his chest. Glass answered to the hand, not the cloth above it.

They passed through the channel markers and into the broader water of the bacino. Gondolas and barges crowded the approach to the city. Cecco threaded between them with the ease of long practice, and the sandolo slid into the mouth of the Grand Canal as smoothly as a needle entering cloth.

Enzo had never seen the canal from the water. He had crossed it on foot at Rialto, hurrying, keeping his eyes down. Now it opened before him like the nave of a cathedral laid on its side, the palazzi rising on both banks in white and pink and grey stone, their windows arched, their water gates dark as open mouths. Morning light struck the upper stories and poured down the facades in long planes of gold. Below, the water held each building doubled and broken, a city inverted and shimmering beneath itself.

He stared. He could not help it.

"The Ca' Morosini," Bardolino said, pointing to the left bank. "Three doors past the red mooring poles."

The palazzo was narrower than its neighbors but taller, four stories of Istrian stone with a loggia on the second floor where pointed arches framed the dark interior. The water gate stood open. A servant in blue livery waited at the landing, and Cecco brought the sandolo alongside with a bump that Enzo felt through the crate.

They unloaded the mirror carefully. Bardolino took one end of the crate, Enzo the other, and they carried it through the water gate into a ground-floor androne that smelled of damp stone and something else — beeswax, perhaps, or the oil used on good wood. The floor was terrazzo, white and grey chips set in red, polished to a sheen that reflected Enzo's shoes as he walked. He was conscious of his shoes. They were the good pair, the ones without cracks in the sole, but they were still the shoes of a boy who ground glass for his wages.

The servant led them up a staircase broad enough for three men abreast. The walls above the first landing were frescoed — a scene Enzo did not immediately recognize, figures in Roman dress arranged around a table, the colors still sharp after what must have been decades. He wanted to stop. He wanted to hold each painted face up to the light the way he held a lens blank, to read its flaws and perfections. Bardolino was already at the top of the stairs.

The portego ran the full depth of the palazzo, its terrazzo floor scattered with Turkish carpets in red and deep blue. Light entered through the loggia windows and laid bright rectangles across the stone. A long table held a silver candelabrum and three glass vessels — two goblets and a footed bowl, all cristallo, all Muranese work. Enzo recognized the technique on the bowl. Barovier. The diamond-point engraving on the rim was unmistakable.

Dona Lucrezia Morosini entered from a side door. She wore black — the perpetual mourning of a Venetian widow — but the fabric was silk so fine it caught light like water, and at her throat a single strand of pearls shone against the dark cloth with the quiet authority of things that cost more than Enzo would earn in five years. Her hair was covered, as was proper, but a few strands of dark brown escaped at her temple. She was not beautiful in the way the frescoed Roman women were beautiful. Her face was too angular, her mouth too firm. But her eyes moved with an intelligence that Enzo recognized because he had seen it in Bardolino — the way a person looked when they were reading the world rather than merely receiving it.

"Maestro Bardolino," she said. "You are prompt. I had not expected you before midday."

"The tide favored us, Dona Lucrezia." Bardolino set his end of the crate down and bowed, not deeply — the bow of a master craftsman, not a supplicant. "And the mirror, if I may say, favored itself. It did not wish to wait."

A faint amusement crossed her face. "Then let us not keep it any longer."

Enzo knelt and began to unwrap the crate. His hands worked the knots without fumbling — he was good with knots, with anything that required precise fingers — and he lifted the mirror free of its straw bedding and held it up, angled to catch the light from the loggia windows.

The cristallo threw that light back with a clarity that still astonished him. The silver backing, applied by Bardolino's own method, turned the glass into a portal through which the room seemed to continue into another, identical room, a world just as real as this one but reversed, existing only in the thin space between glass and metal.

Lucrezia stepped forward. She did not reach for the mirror. She studied it.

"The clarity," she said. "It is finer than the last one you made me."

"My apprentice ground the final polish," Bardolino said. He put his hand on Enzo's shoulder. "Enzo Sforno. He has an eye I have not seen in thirty years at the furnace."

Lucrezia's gaze shifted to Enzo. He felt it move across his face, his hands, his doublet. It paused — he was certain it paused — on the yellow circle. Then it continued, as if the circle were simply another detail of his clothing, no more or less notable than the cut of his sleeves.

"Sforno," she said. "Of the Padua Sforni?"

"My father was Giacomo Sforno, Dona. He ground lenses in Padua before we came to Murano."

"A family trade, then."

"Yes, Dona."

She looked at Bardolino. "You are fortunate in your apprentices, Maestro."

"In this one," Bardolino said. "Yes."

Lucrezia examined the mirror for several more minutes, turning it in the light, running one finger along the beveled edge. She asked two questions about the silver backing that revealed she understood more about the process than most of Bardolino's own workers. Then she nodded to the servant, who brought forward a leather purse. Bardolino received it, weighed it in his palm — a quick, practiced motion — and inclined his head.

"It has been a pleasure, Dona Lucrezia."

"The pleasure is mine." She was still looking at the mirror. "Tell me, Maestro — I have been thinking about commissioning a set of hand mirrors. Smaller, for gifts. Could you produce six of this quality by Carnival?"

Bardolino's answer was immediate. "For you, Dona, I would find a way."

On the staircase going down, Bardolino's hand found Enzo's shoulder again and squeezed. He said nothing until they were back in the androne, the damp stone smell closing around them like a familiar garment. Then he laughed — a deep, hoarse sound that filled the vaulted space.

"Six mirrors by Carnival. Do you know what that means?"

"Work," Enzo said.

"Gold," Bardolino said. "Gold, boy. And more commissions after. She talks to other widows, other wives. This is how a furnace builds a name that lasts."

They climbed back into the sandolo. Cecco pushed off from the landing and the palazzo began to recede, its white stone turning grey as the angle of light changed. Enzo watched it go. He was thinking about the terrazzo floor, the way it had held his reflection. He was thinking about Lucrezia's gaze pausing on the yellow circle and then, deliberately, moving on. A kindness or a calculation. He could not tell which.

The lagoon opened around them as they cleared the canal. Wind came off the water, carrying salt and the smell of turned mud from the shallows. Bardolino sat beside him now, closer than before, the empty crate stowed beneath the thwart.

"Your father," Bardolino said. "He would have liked today."

Enzo rubbed his thumb across the roughened pads of his left fingers. "He never went inside a palazzo."

"No. But he understood quality. He would have known what you did with that polish." Bardolino was quiet for a moment, watching Murano grow larger ahead of them, the furnace chimneys sending their thin lines of smoke into the October sky. "The commission after the next one — the six mirrors — I am going to have you grind the master blanks. Not the finishing work. The blanks themselves."

Enzo turned to look at him.

"You are ready," Bardolino said. "You have been ready for six months. I should have said so sooner."

The master blanks. The first cut, the shaping that determined everything that followed. Only a maestro or a senior journeyman ground the master blanks. For an apprentice — for a Jewish apprentice — it was a door that did not open. Except that Bardolino was opening it, or saying he would, here on the grey water with the smell of salt in the air and the distant furnace smoke rising like threads of pale glass drawn thin against the sky.

"Thank you, Maestro," Enzo said.

Bardolino put his arm around Enzo's shoulders. The weight of it was warm and heavy and real. It was the arm of a man who had carried molten glass on a pontello for forty years, who had lost the tip of a finger to the craft and never once complained of it, who saw in Enzo something worth shaping. It was the arm of a man who kept a locked storeroom with a new lock.

Enzo leaned into it. The boat carried them home.
