The gather came off the pontil clean, a globe of molten cristallo trailing light like a small sun held at the end of an iron rod. Enzo watched from the grinding bench as old Beppe rolled the blowpipe against the arms of his chair, shaping the glass with a patience that made the work look inevitable, as though the bowl had always existed inside the gather and Beppe was merely letting it out. The furnace breathed its steady heat across the workshop, and the air smelled of charcoal and sweat and the mineral tang of silica, and Enzo's hands moved on their own across the lens blank, his roughened fingertips reading the surface the way a blind man reads a face.

Three weeks since the Morosini delivery. The gold had come through — every ducat of it — and Bardolino had paid the suppliers the same afternoon, settling accounts that had stretched through the summer like fraying rope. Now the furnace ran six days again instead of four. The wood stores were full. A new commission had arrived from the Contarini family, a set of goblets for a betrothal feast, and the order was large enough to keep the apprentices busy through Advent.

Good weeks. Enzo could not remember a stretch this fine since before his father died.

He tilted the lens blank toward the window and let the October light pass through it. Clean. No striations, no bubbles caught in the body of the glass. He had ground this one from a cristallo disc that Bardolino himself had blown, and the material was so pure that the finished lens would bend light without distortion, without the faint warping that cheaper glass imposed on everything it touched. Enzo held it up and peered through it at the far wall of the workshop, where the brick wavered and then snapped into a clarity so sharp it almost hurt.

"You'll go blind staring through those things," Marco said, settling onto the bench beside him with a plate of bread and sardines balanced on one enormous knee. Marco Dolfin — Marco the Ox, the other apprentices called him, though never with malice — had a body built for hauling wood and stoking fires, broad across the shoulders and thick through the chest, with hands like shovels and a face that defaulted to cheerful bewilderment. He ate the way he worked: steadily, without hurry, with an air of mild astonishment that there was always more to consume.

"Your mother went blind staring through those things," Enzo said.

"My mother can't read her own name."

"That explains the letters she sends me."

Marco laughed — a big, round, unselfconscious sound that turned heads across the workshop. He pushed half the bread toward Enzo. "Eat. You're getting thin again."

"I'm always thin."

"You're getting thinner. Beppe says you skip the midday meal when you're grinding."

"Beppe should mind his gather."

But he took the bread. It was good bread, dense and dark, and the sardines were fresh from the morning boats, silver-skinned and sharp with salt. They ate together in the companionable quiet of men who worked side by side six days a week, and Enzo watched the furnace crew move through their afternoon rhythms — Beppe shaping, young Alvise carrying the finished pieces to the annealing oven on a wooden paddle, Fredo stoking the firebox with split beechwood — and the warmth of the place settled into his chest like a second heartbeat.

The storeroom door was shut. Locked, as it had been since the summer. He glanced at it and then glanced away, and the thought that rose — the old unease, the memory of shapes under canvas that did not match any glassware he knew — dissolved before it could fully form. Bardolino kept his experimental pieces in there. Every master did. The locked door was caution, not concealment. The furnace was healthy. The debts were paid. What had Serena said? Desperate men make desperate choices. But Bardolino was not desperate anymore. The Morosini gold had seen to that, and the Contarini commission would carry them through winter, and the future opened ahead like a clean stretch of the lagoon on a windless morning.

He rubbed his right thumb across his left fingertips. Habit. The roughness there was a record of his work, every hour at the grinding bench written into his skin, and he liked the feel of it — liked knowing that his hands carried evidence of what they could do.

"Sforno."

He looked up. Bardolino stood in the doorway that led to the showroom, and beside him was a man Enzo did not recognize: short, fiftyish, with a neatly trimmed grey beard and the hands of a craftsman, scarred and capable. He wore a leather apron over good wool. A master, from the look of him.

"Bring the Contarini samples," Bardolino said. "And the small lens. The one you finished Tuesday."

Enzo set aside his bread, wiped his hands on his apron, and retrieved the pieces from the shelf above the grinding bench: three goblet stems in graduated sizes, and the lens, wrapped in soft linen. He carried them to the doorway and held them out, and Bardolino took the stems while the visitor took the lens, unwrapping it with the careful fingers of a man who understood what he was holding.

The visitor turned the lens in the light. He held it at arm's length, then close, then at arm's length again. He sighted through it toward the furnace, where the fire made the air ripple and dance.

"This is the boy's work?" the visitor said.

"All his," Bardolino said. His deep hoarse voice carried a warmth that Enzo had learned, over two years, not to take for granted. "The grinding, the polishing, the final figuring. I set the blank. He does the rest."

"How old?"

"Seventeen."

The visitor looked at Enzo for the first time. His eyes were brown and shrewd and not unkind. "I am Maestro Gasparini," he said. "From the Briati furnace. I came to see the Morosini mirror, but Vittorio tells me it is already delivered."

"Three weeks ago," Enzo said.

"A shame. I have heard it discussed in terms that border on the excessive." He held up the lens again. "This, however, I can see for myself. The figure is very fine. Even, consistent — no thinning at the edges, which is where most apprentice work falls apart. You ground this on a lap?"

"Iron lap, first. Then a pitch lap for the final figure."

"And the polishing compound?"

"Tin oxide in water. Very thin suspension."

Gasparini nodded. He wrapped the lens in its linen and handed it back, and his expression — Enzo could not parse it fully, but there was respect in it, the professional regard of one craftsman for another's work, which was a thing Enzo had never received from anyone outside the Bardolino furnace.

"You have a gift," Gasparini said. "Guard it."

He turned back to Bardolino, and the two men walked into the showroom, their voices dropping to the low murmur of masters discussing trade. Enzo stood in the doorway holding the wrapped lens against his chest, and the afternoon light came through the high windows and caught the glass dust on his apron, turning it to a fine gold powder, and he allowed himself, briefly and completely, to believe that the world was what it appeared to be.

Marco was grinning at him when he returned to the bench. "Maestro Gasparini," Marco said, drawing the name out with mock gravity. "From the Briati furnace. You have a gift, young Sforno. Guard it."

"Shut up."

"Guard it with your life. Guard it with your honor. Guard it with—"

"I will put this lens through your eye."

"You wouldn't waste the lens."

True. Enzo sat down and rewrapped the piece and set it on the shelf, and Marco clapped him on the shoulder with a hand that could have felled a calf, and the afternoon went on.

Near the end of the day, when the light through the windows had turned from gold to copper and the furnace crew was banking the fires for the night, Tomaso crossed the workshop carrying a bundle of iron pontils to the rack. He passed Enzo's bench without stopping, without looking, which was the usual way of things between them — two years of coexistence measured in averted eyes and careful distances. But then he paused. Half-turned.

"The Contarini stems," Tomaso said. "The proportions are good."

Enzo waited. Tomaso's jaw worked, as though the words had cost him something physical to produce. His pale blue eyes met Enzo's and slid away.

"My father says you'll grind the master blanks for the commission after next."

"He mentioned it," Enzo said.

Tomaso shifted the pontils in his arms. A muscle moved in his cheek. "You should," he said. "You're ready."

He walked away before Enzo could respond, and the pontils clanged against the rack as he stowed them with more force than the task required. It was not friendship. Enzo understood that. It was not even warmth. But it was an acknowledgment wrung from a place that did not yield such things easily, and it mattered more than Gasparini's praise, more than Bardolino's promises, because Tomaso had no reason to give it except that it was true.

The apprentices filed out into the October evening. The air off the lagoon was cool and briny, carrying the smell of turned earth from the garden plots behind the houses and the distant salt-rot of exposed mudflats at low tide. Enzo walked with Marco toward the traghetto landing where the boat would take them across to the city. The yellow circle on his doublet caught the last of the light — a small disc of cloth, the color of egg yolk, stitched above his heart. He did not think about it. For once, he did not think about what it marked or what it cost or how it separated him from the men he worked beside. The evening was mild. His hands ached in the good way that meant a full day's work. In his mind he was already planning tomorrow's grinding sequence, already feeling the weight of the blank against the lap, already hearing the soft grit-whisper of tin oxide on glass.

Marco was telling him something about a fisherman's daughter in Cannaregio, a story that required extensive hand gestures and that Enzo suspected was mostly invented, and the water of the lagoon held the last copper light of the sky, and the furnace chimney behind them still trailed a thin line of smoke into the darkening air, and the world was good, the world was whole, and Enzo Sforno — seventeen, alive, talented, afraid of nothing — walked toward the boat landing with his friend beside him and believed, with the full and unguarded conviction of youth, that this was the life he had earned and that it would hold.
