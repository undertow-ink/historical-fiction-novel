The diagram was wrong.

Enzo pressed his roughened fingertip against the margin of the page, tracing the line Alhazen had drawn — or rather, the line some Paduan copyist had drawn from Alhazen's description — showing the path of light striking a curved surface. The angle of incidence matched the angle of reflection. That much he understood. But the copyist had drawn the parabola too shallow, and the reflected rays crossed at a point too far from the mirror's face.

"The focal distance," he said. "It's shorter than this."

Gritti looked up from the lectern where he'd been consulting a printed Euclid, his thick spectacles catching the window light. He adjusted them with ink-darkened fingers, leaving a fresh smudge on the bridge of his nose. "Shorter? How do you — ah, but of course, you've been grinding curves for how long now, two years? Three? The hand knows what the hand knows, as Aristotle would say, though I'm not certain Aristotle said precisely that, but the principle is sound, the principle is — yes, show me."

Enzo turned the manuscript toward him, careful with the pages. Four months he'd had this book. Gritti had not asked for it back, not after the first month nor the second. When Enzo had brought it to the shop in September, offering to return it, Gritti had waved his hand as though dispersing smoke. *Keep it. You're the first person since your father who's actually read it.* So Enzo had kept it. He'd read it through twice, once struggling, once with the grinding forms from the furnace laid out beside him on the table in his rented room, checking Alhazen's curves against the brass templates his own hands shaped glass upon each day.

"Here," Enzo said. He pointed to the diagram. "If the curve is truly parabolic — a section of the cone cut parallel to the side, as he describes — then every ray striking the surface parallel to the axis reflects to the same point. One point. He proves it." His finger moved to the relevant passage. "But the copyist drew a circular arc instead. A circle scatters. A parabola collects."

Gritti bent close. The smell of old parchment and candle wax rose from his coat. "You're right. Santo cielo, you're right, the draftsman has simplified it, or perhaps he didn't understand the distinction. A parabola and a circular arc look so similar at small scales, and if you don't know to look for — but you do know. You know because you grind them."

"A circular lens is easy," Enzo said. "You rock the blank against the form in a natural motion, and the curve comes out spherical. For a parabola, you have to fight the motion. Vary the pressure across the stroke. It takes longer."

"And the result?"

"A cleaner focus."

Gritti's face opened with the particular delight Enzo had come to recognize in him — the look of a man who loved knowledge the way other men loved wine or women, without reservation, without calculation. He pulled the Euclid closer, then pushed it aside and reached instead for a sheaf of loose pages on the shelf behind him, knocking a small codex to the floor without noticing.

"Bacon," Gritti said. "Roger Bacon, the Franciscan, whom I showed you last time — you remember the *Opus Majus*, the section on *scientia experimentalis*? He takes Alhazen's mathematics and extends them. He describes — where is it, where is — here." He thrust the pages toward Enzo. They were copies in a cramped hand, Latin, with marginal annotations in faded red ink. "The *speculum urens*. The burning mirror. Bacon argues that if one could construct a parabolic mirror of sufficient diameter, ground to sufficient precision, the heat concentrated at the focal point would ignite any material placed there. Wood, cloth, even metal at sufficient scale. He cites Archimedes at Syracuse — you know the story?"

"Mirrors against the Roman ships."

"Yes, yes, most scholars call it legend, Desiderius dismissed it entirely, and Polybius doesn't mention it, which is damning since Polybius is generally reliable on military matters, though his account of the siege has lacunae — but Bacon says, and this is the crucial point, Bacon says the mathematics support it. Alhazen's mathematics. The question was never whether light could be concentrated to such intensity. The question was whether any craftsman could grind a reflective surface to a true parabolic curve with sufficient precision." Gritti paused. He adjusted his spectacles. "Bacon didn't know about cristallo."

The word hung in the air of the small shop. Dust turned in the light from the window.

"Cristallo," Enzo repeated.

"Venetian cristallo. Your cristallo, if I may say so, since you help produce it daily. Bacon was writing about polished metal mirrors — bronze, steel — and metals are difficult. They tarnish, they warp, the surface degrades. But glass ground to a parabolic curve and coated with a reflective layer on the back surface — or better yet, used as a refracting lens to bend light rather than reflect it — the precision achievable with cristallo is an order of magnitude beyond anything Bacon could have imagined. Alhazen could not have imagined it either. He was working with rock crystal, with beryl, with the crude glass of his time. Murano cristallo is something else entirely." Gritti's hands moved as he spoke, shaping invisible forms in the air. "If someone were to take Alhazen's theory of parabolic focus and Bacon's principle of the *speculum urens* and apply them using cristallo lenses of the quality your furnace produces — well." He laughed, a short, wondering sound. "It would no longer be legend."

Enzo's hands were flat on the table. He looked at them. The roughened pads of his fingers, the fine white scars from a hundred small cuts, the calluses from the grinding rod. He looked at the diagram in Alhazen's manuscript, the parabolic curve the copyist had drawn wrong but that Enzo's hands knew how to make right.

He thought about the storeroom.

The lenses in the storeroom. The ones Maestro Bardolino kept locked behind the door Enzo was not supposed to open. The ones he had seen three months ago — flat on one side, curved on the other, each the width of a man's spread hand, each ground to a curve that was not the simple spherical arc of a spectacle lens. He had noticed it then, handling them in the dark, running his thumb across the surface and feeling the way the curve deepened toward the edge. Not spherical. He hadn't had the word for it then.

Parabolic.

"The diameter matters," Enzo said. His voice sounded level. Good. "Bacon specifies a minimum?"

"He does, he does — let me find it — he says, and I'm approximating from memory, that for the effect to be militarily practical, one needs either a single mirror of at least three braccia across, which is of course absurd, no one could grind such a thing, or — and this is the more interesting case — an array of smaller mirrors or lenses, each perhaps a palmo in diameter, arranged so their focal points converge on a single target." Gritti made a converging gesture with his hands, fingers meeting at a point. "Like many rivers joining into one. Each lens alone produces only modest heat. Together, at a distance Alhazen calculates based on the curvature and diameter — together they become the fire of Syracuse."

A palmo. Eight, nine inches across. The width of a man's spread hand.

Enzo knew the exact size. He did not need to measure. His hands had held those lenses, turned them, felt the weight and curvature. Fourteen of them, or fifteen — he had counted quickly in the dark, his heart going fast, before he heard the footstep and eased the storeroom door shut.

The curve was right. The size was right. The glass was cristallo, the finest in the world, and the grinding precision was beyond anything the spectacle trade required, beyond anything any customer had ever ordered, beyond anything that made sense for the commercial work of the Bardolino furnace.

Unless the commercial work was not the point.

"Enzo?" Gritti was watching him. "You've gone quiet. I've been talking too much — my wife says I could talk the tide out of the lagoon, and she's not wrong, God rest her, she was never wrong about my failings — are you well?"

"I'm thinking," Enzo said.

"Of course. Of course you are. Your father did the same thing — he would go silent for minutes at a time while something worked itself through. I always envied that capacity for sustained — but never mind. Take the Bacon pages. I have another copy somewhere, or I can get one from the printer in Padua. Take them, read them alongside the Alhazen. The sections on refraction in Book Seven are essential. If you work through the geometry of converging focal points, I think you'll find the mathematics quite beautiful. Quite — forgive me — quite elegant in the way they unify Alhazen's theory of individual reflection with Bacon's vision of collective application."

Enzo gathered the pages. His fingers were steady. He placed them inside the Alhazen manuscript, which he'd wrapped in the same linen cloth Gritti had given him months ago, and tied the cord with the knot he used on the grinding forms.

"Thank you," he said.

"What for? The books want to be read. They've been waiting for someone like you. Your father, God keep him, he would have — but that's not my place to say." Gritti adjusted his spectacles. "Bring the Bacon back when you're done. Or don't. Come back regardless. We'll talk about catoptrics."

Enzo stepped out of the shop into the calle. The October air hit his face, carrying the salt of the lagoon and the smoke of a charcoal seller's brazier two doors down. The yellow circle on his doublet caught on a splinter of the doorframe, and he freed it with a tug. He stood in the narrow street with the wrapped manuscript against his chest and the knowledge inside him like a crack propagating through a vessel still holding its shape — invisible, silent, and total.

Bardolino was building a weapon.

The lenses, the curves, the impossible precision, the secrecy. An array of parabolic cristallo lenses, each converging light to a single point. The fire of Syracuse, made real with Murano glass.

He walked toward the traghetto. The canal water was dark, and the light on its surface broke and reformed with each passing boat, scattered and gathered and scattered again, the way Alhazen said all light behaved — striking, refracting, reflecting — following laws as fixed as the laws of God, laws that could be understood and used and aimed.

Enzo carried the manuscript. He did not look back at the painted sign of the open book. He was thinking about fourteen lenses in a locked room, and what they were for, and who had ordered them, and what he was supposed to do now that the theory in his hands and the evidence in his memory had fused into a single, clear, unbearable line of sight.
