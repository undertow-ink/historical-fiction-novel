The smell hit him first — too many bodies in the calle, sweat and wool and the sharp tang of fear that no one would name but everyone recognized. Enzo turned the corner into the sottoportego and stopped. A dozen people stood clustered outside the Meshullam house, speaking in voices that overlapped and broke against each other like water against fondamenta stones. Old Shmuel had his hand on the doorframe as though the wall might move. Two women Enzo did not know pressed close together, one gripping the other's sleeve.

He pushed through. No one stopped him. No one even looked at the yellow circle on his doublet, which meant whatever had happened was large enough to make the small persecutions invisible.

"Florence," someone said. The word passed from mouth to mouth with the efficiency of flame through a glory hole. "Florence has fallen. The Medici boy ran. The French walked in like they owned it."

Enzo's hands went to his belt, a habit when he needed to hold something. Florence. Three weeks ago the news had been the Alps, the army crossing into Lombardy, and the Rialto had shuddered and repriced, and he had felt the first cold draft of what it meant for an army to be in Italy. He had talked himself past it since. The furnace ran well. Bardolino was busy with commissions. The storeroom was just a storeroom.

He moved through the calle toward home, and the quarter unfolded around him in its distress. Doors that were usually shut stood open. He passed the Luzzatto house and heard arguing inside — a man's voice rising, a woman's cutting it short. Near the well, three boys younger than him sat on the stone lip and watched the adults with that particular stillness of children who understood the shape of danger before they could name it. A cat threaded between legs, indifferent.

At the synagogue entrance, a press of men waited for evening prayers. More than usual. Enzo saw Rabbi Yehudah near the door, his white beard bright against his dark robe, speaking to David ha-Kohen the cloth merchant. The Rabbi's hands were still. That was how you knew he was serious — when the hands stopped moving, the mind was working at its sharpest.

Enzo waited. David ha-Kohen moved on, and the Rabbi's brown eyes found him.

"You've heard," Enzo said.

"I have ears." The Rabbi tilted his head. "And you? What did you hear?"

"Florence fell. The French are moving south."

"South. Yes." Rabbi Yehudah looked past Enzo, toward the sottoportego, where voices still tangled. "And what does a French army moving south mean for a city that sits on water?"

Enzo had already thought about this. "Venice will have to choose. Alliance or neutrality."

"And when the Republic chooses, it chooses with its full attention. All of its attention." The Rabbi's gaze returned to him, steady and without comfort. "I told you once what happens when Christians must decide. Do you remember?"

"They look for someone to blame."

"They look for someone who is already marked." The Rabbi touched his own chest, where a yellow circle would sit if he wore a doublet instead of a scholar's robe. His fingers rested there for a moment, then dropped. "Pray with us tonight."

"I will."

The Rabbi nodded once and turned to greet the next man waiting. The conversation was over. It had lasted perhaps forty seconds. It would sit in Enzo for much longer than that.

He climbed the stairs to the second floor two at a time, the wood groaning under his weight. The door was ajar. Inside, the main room held the last thin light of November, grey and reluctant through the single window. His mother stood at the table with her back to him, her hands working dough for challah, though Shabbat was still two days away. She was making bread because her hands needed occupation. He knew this about her. When Mirela Sforno was at ease, she hummed. When she was not, she worked.

She was not humming.

"Mama."

She turned. Her eyes moved over him — face, hands, doublet — the quick inventory of a woman who had already lost one person and would not lose another without a fight. The flour on her reddened knuckles looked like ash.

"Sit," she said. "Eat something."

"I'm not hungry."

"I didn't ask if you were hungry. Sit."

He sat. She put bread and oil in front of him, yesterday's bread, the crust hard but the inside still good. He tore a piece and chewed because it was easier than arguing. The room smelled of yeast and rosemary and the faint persistent damp that lived in every wall in Cannaregio. On the other side of the room, his father's workbench held its shapes in the dimness — the grinding lap, the pitch blocks, the calipers, all untouched since Giacomo's death, coated in a fine dust that his mother would not let him clean.

"The whole quarter is talking," Enzo said.

"Let them talk." She punched the dough, turned it, punched again. "Talk is what people do when they cannot act."

"The French took Florence without a siege. Without resistance. Piero de' Medici just — gave them what they wanted and ran."

Her hands stopped. Only for a moment, but he saw it. Then they resumed their rhythm, pressing and folding, pressing and folding.

"Naples is next," he said. "Everyone knows it."

"Naples is far away."

"The war isn't. The war is in Italy now, Mama. The Republic will have to respond. They'll need ships, they'll need weapons, they'll need —"

"Stop." Her voice dropped low. Not a whisper, but close to it, the register she used when the walls might be listening. "You will not talk about weapons. Not in this house."

Something in her tone caught him. Not the words — the tension beneath them, an old weight she carried and would not set down. He watched her hands in the dough, the red skin, the flour caught in the creases of her knuckles.

"The furnace is just making lenses," he said. Carefully.

She did not look at him. "Your father said the same thing."

The air in the room changed. It was the closest she had come to saying it — whatever it was she knew about Giacomo and the furnace and the way he had died. Enzo opened his mouth, but she shook her head, a small sharp motion, and he understood that the door she had cracked would not open further tonight.

"Eat your bread," Mirela said. "And stay away from talk about the war. We are Jews in a Christian city. Our safety is their patience, and patience runs out."

He finished the bread. He helped her clean the table. They spoke of small things — a leak in the ceiling that needed pitch, a delivery of firewood that had not arrived, the cost of oil going up again since the news from the Alps. Normal words laid over abnormal fear, like a thin gather of glass over a bubble that would not hold.

After she lit the evening lamp and retired behind the curtain to the second room, Enzo sat alone at the table. The lamp threw a circle of yellow light across the wood surface, and beyond it the room was dark, and in that darkness his father's workbench waited with its precise collection of tools and its silence.

He thought about Alhazen. He had spent the afternoon in Gritti's bookshop working through the geometry of parabolic mirrors — the way a curve of exactly the right shape could gather every ray of light that struck it and send them all to a single point. A burning point. The speculum urens. He had admired the mathematics. He had felt the pleasure of a problem yielding to careful thought, each line of reasoning fitting into the next like ground glass settling into its frame.

Now he laid the mathematics over the world.

A parabolic mirror, large enough, aimed at a ship's rigging or its pitch-sealed hull. Concentrated sunlight. Fire at a distance, without catapult or cannon, without powder or shot. A weapon that could burn a fleet from a harbor wall.

The components in Bardolino's storeroom. The curved blanks he had assumed were mirror substrates for wealthy buyers. The grinding compounds ordered in quantities that made no sense for spectacle lenses. The correspondence with Ferrara that Bardolino kept locked in his study. The measurements Enzo himself had helped take, not understanding what they described. A parabolic curve. The focal length calculated for distance, not for reading or magnification.

He pressed his roughened fingertips against the tabletop until the wood grain bit into his skin. Each piece had existed separately — the storeroom, the mathematics, the politics — and he had allowed them to remain separate because separated they were tolerable. A merchant keeps unusual stock. A scholar studies ancient texts. A king invades a neighboring country. These things happened in the world. They did not have to be connected.

But they were connected. The curve was a weapon. The war needed weapons. Venice needed to control the sea. And Bardolino had been building — was building, had perhaps been building for years, since before Giacomo died — the apparatus to deliver fire at a distance to anything that floated within range of the Arsenal's walls.

His father had worked at that furnace. His father had ground lenses at that furnace. His father was dead.

Enzo pulled his hands from the table and looked at them in the lamplight. The calluses on his fingertips, the fine scratches from grinding compound, the permanent roughness that no amount of oil would soften. These hands had helped shape the pieces in that storeroom. Not knowingly. Not willingly. But the glass did not care about intention. It held whatever shape you gave it, and the shape he had helped give it was a weapon.

The lamp guttered. Oil running low. He should refill it or let it die. Outside, the quarter had gone quiet, the voices absorbed into houses, into prayers, into the particular silence of people waiting for news they did not want to receive.

He let the flame go out. In the darkness, the knowledge sat in him the way heat sat in glass after it left the furnace — invisible but present, altering the structure of everything it touched. He could not return it to the fire. He could not grind it down to nothing. He could not talk himself past it again.

The warm weeks were a country he had already left, though he had not known he was walking until he arrived here, in the dark, with the smell of his mother's bread and the shape of his father's tools and the geometry of a weapon that the Republic would buy at any price from anyone who could build it.

Tomorrow he would go back to the furnace. He would grind lenses. He would watch Bardolino's face and try to read what was written there. But tonight the knowledge was enough. Tonight it was all he could carry.
