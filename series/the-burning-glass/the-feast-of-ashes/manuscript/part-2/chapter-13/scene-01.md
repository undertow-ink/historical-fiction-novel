The grit sang against glass, a sound like sand driven across a frozen canal. Enzo kept his rhythm steady — left hand guiding the blank, right hand pressing the grinding tool in slow arcs across the surface — though the work had lost its purpose an hour ago. The lens he shaped was a simple convex, a reading stone for some mainland presbyter whose eyes had failed him, and it needed perhaps ten more minutes of his attention. He was giving it the full night instead.

The furnace behind him had been banked since vespers. Its coals pulsed through the half-open bocca, casting a low orange light that barely reached the grinding bench. November darkness pressed against the workshop's windows, and the canal water outside made its small lapping sounds against the fondamenta. On Murano, at this hour, there was little else. The other apprentices had gone to their beds in the room above the annealing ovens, where the residual heat kept the damp from settling into bones. Enzo had told Marco he wanted to finish the presbyter's lens. Marco had shrugged and gone up.

Enzo worked, and watched, and waited.

Three weeks of this. Three weeks since the arithmetic had resolved itself in his mind with the clarity of a well-ground surface — since the curvatures he had been cutting for Bardolino, those deep parabolic sweeps that no spectacle-maker would ever need, had matched themselves to a design he carried behind his eyes like a scar. Fra Giordano's letters to Bardolino. The passage in Alhazen that Gritti had translated for him, months ago now, about the geometry of burning mirrors. The way cristallo transmitted light with so little loss, like canal water in January, clear enough to read the mosaic on the bottom. All of it fitting together with a precision that left no tolerance, no gap for doubt to nest in.

And yet he had gone on grinding. Because knowing a thing in the mind was not the same as knowing it in the hands.

The sound came across the water first — oars, not the heavy splash of a supply barge from Mestre but the quick, muffled stroke of a lighter craft approaching from the south. From Venice. Enzo's hands stilled on the glass. He set down the grinding tool and wiped his fingers on his leather apron, then moved to the window.

A sandolo, low in the water, its lantern shuttered. Two figures on the fondamenta already, which meant a third at the oars. One of the figures was Bardolino — Enzo knew his master's shape, the heavy shoulders, the way he planted his feet wide as though perpetually bracing against a ship's roll. The other was taller, thinner, wrapped in a dark cloak with the hood drawn forward. The way this second man stood — weight on his heels, chin lifted, the particular stillness of someone accustomed to being waited upon — told Enzo nothing certain and several things probable.

Between them, they hefted a crate from the sandolo's belly. It was not large but it bowed their arms, and Bardolino grunted as they swung it onto the fondamenta. The boatman passed up a second, smaller parcel wrapped in oilcloth. Then the sandolo pulled away without a word, its oars dipping with professional silence, and the two men carried their burden through the workshop's canal-side door.

Enzo was already across the room, crouched behind the annealing oven where its bulk hid him in shadow. He heard their footsteps — Bardolino's heavy, the stranger's measured — cross the workshop floor. The scrape of the iron key in the storeroom lock. The oak door groaning on its hinges. Their voices, low as the furnace's banked murmur, exchanging words he could not parse however he strained. A laugh from the stranger, brief and dry. Then silence, longer. Then the storeroom door again, and footsteps, and Bardolino's voice at normal volume saying something about the tide, and the canal-side door closing behind them both.

Their steps receded along the fondamenta. Enzo did not move. He counted sixty breaths, slow, the way he paced himself when waiting for a melt to reach working temperature. At forty he heard the sandolo's oars again, farther now, heading back toward Venice. At sixty he rose.

The storeroom door was closed. He laid his hand on the iron ring and turned it, and the latch lifted without resistance. Bardolino had not locked it. Perhaps the visitor's presence had disrupted his habit, or perhaps he intended to return before dawn and saw no need. It did not matter. The door opened and Enzo stepped through into the close dark.

The smell was the first thing, as always — sawdust and linseed oil and the faint metallic sweetness of ground glass, a smell he carried in his own skin by now. He left the door open a hand's width behind him so the faint glow from the banked furnace would give him something to work with. His eyes adjusted. The crates along the walls, straw spilling from their open mouths. The strongbox beneath the far shelf. The vellum drawings pinned to the wall above the workbench, Fra Giordano's precise hand rendered in iron gall ink, though in this light they were only pale rectangles.

On the workbench: the device.

He had expected to find it. He had not expected the way his stomach dropped at the sight of it, the way his body understood before his mind had finished cataloguing what he saw. It sat on a square of felted wool, perhaps two feet long, assembled with a care that spoke of many hands over many months. The brass housing gleamed dully in the orange half-light — a tube, but not a simple tube. It was sectioned, each segment joined to the next by machined collars that allowed fine adjustment, the kind of work that came from an instrument-maker's shop, not a glassworks. At the forward end, a mounting ring held a lens he recognized.

He recognized it because he had ground its curvature.

The blank had been one of Bardolino's special commissions — cristallo of extraordinary clarity, poured from a melt that used only the finest Levantine soda ash and Ticino river pebbles. Enzo had spent four days on its primary curve, a deep parabolic sweep that Bardolino said was for a new design of lighthouse reflector. The lie had been smooth and Enzo had believed it, or told himself he did. Now the lens sat in its brass collar, polished to a transparency that made it nearly invisible edge-on, and it was not alone.

Behind it, spaced at intervals along the tube's interior, two more lenses of descending size caught the faint light. Enzo bent close. The second was also cristallo, its curve shallower, a correcting element to manage the aberration that any single parabolic lens would introduce. The third, at the narrow end of the housing, was smaller than his thumbnail and ground with a precision he could appreciate but had not produced — a Venetian artisan's work, or perhaps Florentine. An eyepiece.

At the rear of the assembly, behind the eyepiece, a mirror array. Three polished speculum plates — he touched one with his fingertip, feather-light, the craftsman's reflex — mounted in a brass frame that allowed each to be tilted independently. The metalwork was beautiful. The design was clear, was obvious, was exactly what the mathematics demanded.

He straightened. Looked at the device. Looked away. The crate the two men had carried sat open at the bench's far end, packed with straw, and from it Bardolino had lifted this thing that was not a lighthouse reflector, was not a reading glass, was not any instrument for which an innocent name existed.

Enzo leaned down and set his eye to the eyepiece.

The far wall of the storeroom — six feet away, rough plaster, a crack running through it that he had noticed a hundred times — leapt at him with a clarity that stopped his breath. Every grain of the plaster was distinct. The crack was a canyon, its edges sharp and shadowed. He could see, embedded in the surface, a splinter of wood no larger than an eyelash, something he had never noticed with his bare eye though he had stood in this room for months.

He pulled back. His hands had a tremor in them he could not stop.

The bocca of the furnace was visible through the storeroom door — that hand's-width gap he had left for light. Through it, the banked coals gave their deep orange glow. Enzo gripped the base of the device, lifted it — it was heavier than he expected, the brass and glass together weighing perhaps fifteen pounds — and angled the forward lens toward that gap, toward the coals.

He put his eye to the eyepiece again.

The orange glow was gone. In its place: a point of light so concentrated it was white at the center, ringed with blue, like the hottest moment of a gather on the blowpipe when the glass itself seemed to burn. The coals were twenty feet away and banked low, barely alive, and through this assembly of glass and brass their fading heat had been gathered and compressed into something that hurt to look at.

Enzo pulled his eye away. His vision swam with the afterimage, a bright disk floating against the dark. He blinked, waited, breathed. Then he moved his left hand into the space between the device and the wall — into the path where the light converged.

Heat. Not warmth. Heat, concentrated and specific, a point of fire on his palm no wider than a Venetian ducat. He held his hand steady for two seconds, three, and the sensation intensified from warmth to sting to the precise, clean pain of touching a surface that had been too near the furnace. He pulled his hand back and pressed his fingers to his lips. The skin of his palm was red in a small circle. Banked coals. November. Night.

Under the sun — the full, unforgiving sun of a Venetian July, pouring through cristallo lenses ground to parabolic perfection — this device would not sting. It would ignite. Wood, cloth, pitch, rope, sail, flesh. At distances the mind refused to calculate, because calculating them would mean admitting what this object was, and what Maestro Bardolino had spent the last year building, and what Enzo's own hands had helped to shape.

He set the device down on its felted square. His movements were careful, controlled, as though he handled hot glass on the pontil — the body remembering its discipline when the mind could not. He tilted each mirror plate back to its original angle. He checked the bench for any sign of disturbance, any shifted tool, any displaced grain of sawdust. There was none. He had touched only the device and the single speculum plate, and both were as he had found them.

He stepped out of the storeroom. Pulled the door shut until the latch caught. Stood in the dark workshop with the furnace at his back, its low heat reaching him through his shirt, and the canal water making its indifferent sounds against the fondamenta outside. The presbyter's half-finished lens waited on the grinding bench, the tool beside it, the grit dried to a pale crust on the glass. Everything as he had left it. Everything the same, except that now the shapes under canvas from months ago had names, and the parabolic curves had a purpose, and the correspondence in the strongbox had an architecture he could see whole and entire, the way you saw a finished piece of glass in the raw gather before you ever touched the blowpipe to it.

The red circle on his palm throbbed once, twice, in time with his pulse. He closed his hand around it, pressing the heat against his own fingers, holding the proof where no one could see it. Across the canal, a night heron called — a single harsh note — and was silent.

He could not un-know this.
