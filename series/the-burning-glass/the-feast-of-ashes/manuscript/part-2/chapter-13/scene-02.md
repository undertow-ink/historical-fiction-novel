His hands found the grinding wheel in the dark.

The storeroom door was closed behind him, the wedge replaced, the cloth re-draped over the device. He had been careful. He was always careful — that was the thing about him that people praised, the quality Bardolino had named the first week: *steady hands, steady eye*. Enzo stood at his station in the unlit workshop and pressed his palms flat against the stone wheel, and the grit bit into skin already roughened past feeling. Familiar. The particular cool of polished granite against the meat of his thumbs. He had touched this wheel every day for three years. He knew its surface the way the blind know faces.

The furnace across the room held its banked coals in a low orange murmur, and that light was the only light, and it made the workshop into a place of soft shadows where the grinding wheels and pontils and blowpipes hung like the ribs of some sleeping animal. He knew this room. He had memorized it the way a boy memorizes a prayer, by repetition so deep it bypasses thought and lives in the body. The position of every tool. The particular creak of the second floorboard from the annealing oven. The smell — calcium and sand and the mineral ghost of molten silica that never fully left the walls.

All of it was the same.

None of it was the same.

He stood still and let the understanding come, because there was nowhere to go with it and no one to tell. The device in the storeroom was real. He had looked through it. He had felt the heat on his hand — focused, concentrated, deliberate heat gathered from the furnace's fading coals and driven through curved glass into a point that could burn. The lenses were ground to specifications he recognized because he had ground four of them himself, the master blanks Bardolino had praised with such evident pride. *You have your father's gift.* The old man's voice thick with something Enzo had taken for tenderness. Perhaps it was tenderness. Perhaps it was also something else, and the two had never been separate, and Enzo had simply lacked the instrument to distinguish them.

Until now.

A memory surfaced: the boat from Morosini's palazzo three weeks ago, the lagoon bronze and still, and Bardolino's hand on his shoulder — heavy, warm, the hand with the missing fingertip pressing through the wool of Enzo's doublet. *You did well tonight, boy. You carried yourself well.* And Enzo had flushed with pleasure because praise from Bardolino was rare and therefore precious, and he had thought: *This is what it would be like to have a father.* He thought it knowing his own father was dead. He thought it knowing Bardolino was the one who had taken him in after.

The hand on his shoulder. He could still feel its pressure. It had been real — the warmth, the approval, the rough affection of a man who had no living sons and who saw something in a Jewish apprentice worth cultivating. All of that was true. Enzo would not unmake it. But the hand had also been the hand of a man who knew what the lenses were for, who had designed the brass housing and the pivoting mirror array and had commissioned an orphaned boy to grind the glass that would focus light into a weapon, and who had done all of this while standing close enough for Enzo to smell the sulfur and rosemary on his clothes. The hand on his shoulder was an anchor and a leash and Enzo could not determine where one ended and the other began because they were the same hand.

That was the thing he could not resolve. Not a clean fracture. A crack that ran through the entire vessel, visible only when you held it to the light at the proper angle, and once seen, impossible to unsee. The vessel still held water. The vessel was broken.

He pressed harder against the grinding wheel. The grit sang against his calluses.

Bardolino's lie about the storeroom. Months ago — no, longer, nearly a year. Enzo had asked about the locked door, and the old man had waved a hand with a casualness that must have cost him something, or perhaps it had cost him nothing at all, perhaps lying to the boy was easy by then: *Glassware for a cardinal's table, nothing more.* And Enzo had believed him. Of course he had believed him. The lie was designed for a boy who wanted to believe, who needed the workshop to be safe and the master to be trustworthy and the locked door to contain nothing worse than fragile luxury. Enzo had taken the lie and folded it into the architecture of his days and built upon it, because that was what he did, that was his gift and his flaw — he built. He ground lenses and he built worlds in which the lenses had innocent purposes, and he never tested the foundation because testing it would mean admitting he had built on another man's land.

Rabbi Yehudah's parable. The man who builds a house on ground that does not belong to him. What happens when the owner returns? *He loses the house. He loses the labor. He keeps only the knowledge of what he built and the calluses on his hands.*

Enzo looked at his hands in the dim furnace-light. The calluses were his. The knowledge was his. The workshop, the wheel, the craft he loved — none of it was his.

And his father. Giacomo.

He did not want to follow that thought. His body resisted it the way a hand resists a hot surface, pulling back before the mind has time to calculate the temperature. But the thought was already forming, had been forming since the moment he looked through the device and felt the heat on his skin, and resistance would not stop it any more than closing your eyes stops the sun.

His father had ground lenses at this furnace. His father had died in a furnace explosion, here, in this building, three years ago. Those were facts Enzo had carried separately, the way you carry two reagents that must not touch. The death was an accident. The work was innocent. The master who employed Giacomo was a good man who, out of grief and obligation, took in the dead man's son.

The new lens showed a different image. The same facts, the same light, but focused through a curve that gathered them into a single burning point: his father had ground lenses for this same project. His father had known, or learned, or asked one question too many. And his father was dead.

Enzo could not prove it. He had no evidence beyond the device itself and the terrible logic of proximity. But the shape was there, the way a shape is present in a blank of raw glass before the grinding begins — implicit, waiting, needing only the removal of what obscures it.

Serena's voice, quiet and precise on the fondamenta at dusk: *Desperate men make desperate choices.* She had been talking about Bardolino's debts, about the dwindling furnace, about the numbers in her ledgers that told a story of a man running out of time. He had listened and nodded and filed it away as a thing that applied to Bardolino's finances. Not to the locked storeroom. Not to the device. Not to the question of what a desperate man might do when someone — a friend, a colleague, a lens grinder named Giacomo — asked one too many questions about what the lenses were actually for.

The yellow circle on his doublet. He touched it with his fingertips, a gesture so habitual he often did not notice it, the way a man touches a scar. The circle was there the day Bardolino hired him. It was there every morning when he walked from Cannaregio to the fondamenta and took the boat across. It was there when Christian apprentices looked past him or through him. It marked him as the thing the world had decided he was before he was born, and the lie he had built his life around — *be skilled enough, be useful enough, and they will have to accept you, they will have to keep you safe* — that lie was not Bardolino's invention. It was older than Bardolino. It was the lie every Jewish father whispered to every Jewish son, and it was the lie Enzo had swallowed whole because the alternative was to admit that no amount of skill would transmute the yellow circle into a key. The circle was a circle. The door did not open from this side.

He released the grinding wheel. His palms ached faintly where the grit had pressed its pattern into the skin, tiny constellations of indentation that would fade by morning. Three years of work. Three years of believing that the workshop was a world he could earn his way into, that craft was a country where citizenship was granted on merit, that Bardolino's warmth was proof that the system's cruelties had exceptions.

The warmth was real. The cruelty was also real. They were not opposites. They were the same substance shaped by different hands, and the man who loved him had also used him, and the man who used him had also loved him, and Enzo would have to carry both of those truths for the rest of his life because putting either one down would be a lie.

The false goal died quietly. No ceremony. He would not become a master craftsman in Bardolino's workshop. He would not keep his head down. The head-down life required ignorance, and ignorance was behind him now, sealed in a storeroom he could never un-enter. What remained was the device, the conspiracy it implied, the web of names and motives he did not yet understand, and a question that had no safe answer: *What do you do when you know?*

He crossed the workshop. His feet knew the path — three steps past the grinding station, left around the batch table, six steps to the door. The iron latch was cold under his hand. He lifted it.

Outside, the air carried salt and rot and the mineral breath of cooling furnaces. Murano's chimneys drew dark columns against a sky dense with stars. Across the canal, another workshop's furnace vented a thin ribbon of smoke that rose straight in the windless night and dissolved.

He was seventeen years old. He stood in the doorway with the workshop behind him and the night ahead, and the last world in which things were simple was already gone.
