The grinding lap was cold under his fingers. Enzo stood at the workbench with his hand flat on the cast-iron disc, feeling the familiar curvature against his palm, and for a moment he could not move. Dust covered everything — the lap, the pitch blocks, the calipers laid open like a compass frozen mid-calculation — and where his hand pressed, the iron showed through, dark and clean.

He had not touched this bench in fourteen months.

From the canal below came the knock of boats against the water stairs and, farther off, the voices of women at the washing stones. His mother's voice would be among them. She left before dawn on washing days, arms full of other people's linen, and she would not return until the light failed. He had the hours. What he did not have was steadiness in his hands, and he needed that, so he waited until the tremor passed and then lifted the lap from its wooden base.

Nothing beneath it. Only the circular impression where iron had rested on oak, a ring of clean wood inside a field of dust. He set the lap down and moved to the pitch blocks. Three of them, each the size of a man's fist, black and cracked with age. Giacomo had cast them himself, mixing pine pitch with brick dust and beeswax until the compound was stiff enough to hold a lens during polishing but soft enough to yield under the grinder's pressure. Enzo picked up the first block and turned it. Solid. The second, the same. The third was lighter.

He held it closer to the window. The December light was thin and gray, coming through oiled linen rather than glass — they had never been able to afford glass for their own windows, even when his father ground lenses for half the spectacle makers in the Ghetto. The pitch block's surface was crazed with tiny fractures where the compound had dried and shrunk. Along the bottom edge, a hairline seam ran in a straight line that pitch did not make on its own.

Enzo pressed his thumbnail into the seam. The block split along a hidden joint, its lower third separating from the body, and inside the hollow his father had carved out of the pitch sat a notebook no larger than a hand. Leather cover, dark with handling. Enzo's fingers left marks in the dust as he lifted it free.

He opened it and his father's handwriting filled the page.

The script was small and slanted leftward, the way Giacomo always wrote, pressing hard on the downstrokes so the ink thickened at the base of every letter. Enzo knew this hand from years of reading labels on lens cases, notes left on the kitchen table, the careful Hebrew of Shabbat prayers written out for a boy still learning. Here the hand moved through numbers. Columns of figures ran down the first pages: radii of curvature, thicknesses at center and edge, focal lengths calculated and recalculated with small corrections noted in the margins. A craftsman's working record. Each entry marked with a date — the earliest from March of 1493, nine months before the explosion.

Enzo carried the notebook to the window and read standing, tilting the pages to catch the light.

The calculations described a lens unlike anything ground for spectacles. The curvature was parabolic, not spherical — his father had sketched the distinction on one page, two arcs side by side, one circular and one opening along a shallower path, and had written beneath the sketch: *Surface must not deviate from the conic by more than half a hair's breadth. Test with the template.* Enzo recognized the curve. He had been grinding it for three months in Bardolino's workshop. He had cut templates to that exact profile, checking his work by candlelight, scraping and testing and scraping again until the gap between template and glass vanished.

His father had done the same work. The same lenses. The same impossible curvature that served no purpose Enzo had been taught.

He turned pages. The entries grew denser through the spring and summer. Giacomo had experimented with different glass types — cristallo too soft, vetro di piombo better but the lead content shifted the refraction, common vitrum blanchum from the Murano seconds bin surprisingly adequate if the batch was consistent. Enzo read these notes the way he would read a lens under the test glass, checking for distortion, looking for where the work bent away from what was true. His father's methods were precise. Meticulous. The diagrams showed not single lenses but arrays — groups of lenses arranged along an axis, each ground to a different specification, focal lengths calculated so that light passing through the first would converge at a point inside the second and emerge from the third concentrated into a beam no wider than a needle.

*For the friar's instrument*, Giacomo had written in September. Nothing more. No name, no description of what the instrument did, only that phrase repeated three times across as many pages, as if the destination of the work mattered less than the precision of each surface.

Then October. The entries changed.

Enzo turned a page and the columns of figures broke apart. His father's handwriting, always controlled, grew cramped and hurried. Whole lines were crossed out. On one page Giacomo had begun a calculation, abandoned it, and written below in a script so compressed Enzo had to hold the notebook almost against his nose to read it:

*I asked what application requires this convergence. He would not say. Three lenses of this power in series will focus enough light to ignite tinder at forty braccia. No philosophical instrument needs such concentration. I have written to the friar and received no answer. I think they do not mean to look through this device. I think they mean to look along it, at the place where the beam falls.*

Enzo read the passage twice. His lips shaped the words without sound. *Ignite tinder at forty braccia.* He thought of the storeroom lenses in their velvet-lined cases, Bardolino's hands trembling as he locked the cabinet, the drawings Enzo had found showing a tubular housing with the lenses mounted in sequence. A device to make fire at a distance. Not a telescope. Not a reading instrument. A weapon that used light itself, silent and invisible until the moment the focused beam touched its target and the target burned.

His father had seen it. Had worked it out from the specifications alone, the way Enzo had worked it out, because a man who grinds lenses understands what concentrated light can do. Giacomo had written his doubts into this notebook and hidden the notebook inside a pitch block on his own workbench, where only another grinder would think to look.

The last entry was dated the eighteenth of November, 1493. Three days before the explosion. Three days before Giacomo went to the furnace on Murano where the blanks were cast and did not come back. The entry was short.

*Spoke to B. today. Told him I will grind no more of these. He was afraid. He said there are men behind the friar who will not accept a refusal. I said let them come. My hands, my work, my sin if I continue. Let them come.*

The notebook ended there. The remaining pages were blank.

Enzo closed the cover. Dust from the pitch block had settled into the creases of his knuckles, and he looked at his hands — the roughened fingertips, the calluses on his right thumb and forefinger from holding lens blanks against the wheel — and saw his father's hands. The same trade had marked them in the same places. Giacomo had sat at this bench and worked these same calculations and arrived at the same knowledge, and then he had refused, and then he had died.

*Spoke to B.*

Bardolino. It had to be Bardolino, who kept the storeroom locked and flinched when Enzo asked questions and carried in his lined face the look of a man who had been carrying something for a long time and could not set it down. Bardolino, who had taken on the dead man's son as an apprentice and set him to grinding the dead man's lenses. Whether that was guilt or expedience or some entanglement of the two, Enzo could not tell. But the old man had known. Had known from the beginning what Giacomo discovered only at the end.

He slid the notebook inside his doublet, against his chest, where the leather sat cool and firm against his skin. Then he took the hollow pitch block and pressed its halves together and set it back in line with the others, turning the seam toward the wall. He brushed the surface of the bench with his sleeve until the dust looked as undisturbed as he could make it, and he checked the lap, the calipers, the position of each tool against the ghostly outlines their long rest had printed in the dust.

When he stepped back, the workbench looked the same. His mother would not know. The shrine was intact, the dust unbroken to any eye that was not searching for disturbance, and beneath his doublet his father's last testimony pressed against his ribs with every breath.

Outside, the light on the canal had not changed. The same gray December morning that had watched him open the pitch block now watched him stand at the window with his father's knowledge lodged in his chest. But the room was different, or he was different in it. He had come to the bench looking for evidence that his father's death was not what it appeared. He had found something worse. His father had known, had refused, had been killed for refusing — and the work had continued anyway, passed to a boy who did not know what he was grinding, who shaped the same parabolic curves with the same careful hands and called it craft.

The lenses on Bardolino's shelf were waiting for him. Tomorrow he would go back to the workshop and sit at the grinding bench and pick up a blank, and Bardolino would watch him, and neither of them would speak of what lay between them. But Enzo would know. He pressed his hand flat against his chest where the notebook rested and felt the edges of its pages through the cloth.

His father had let them come. They came.
