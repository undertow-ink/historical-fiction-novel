The emery paste had gone cold on the blank. Enzo worked it anyway, pressing the iron tool in slow circles against the surface of the lens, feeling for the moment when friction caught and the glass began to yield. His fingertips read the work better than his eyes could in this light — two tallow candles at the bench, the furnace banked low, the workshop emptied hours ago. He kept his breathing even. He kept his hands moving.

Outside, the fondamenta was quiet. Then it was not.

The boat came without a lantern. He heard the hull first, the soft knock of wood against the mooring post, and then the creak of a rope pulled taut. Footsteps on stone. Two men, from the sound of it — one heavy, one light. Enzo did not look up from the blank. He had learned, in the weeks since he'd first read his father's journal, that the body was the first thing to betray you. A turned head, a stiffened shoulder, the particular stillness of a man who is listening too hard. He ground the lens. He let the sound come to him.

A door opened at the far end of the building. Bardolino's voice, low and warm, the way it always was when he greeted someone he expected. Enzo could not make out the words. He did not need to. This was the fourth time.

The first had been three days after he found the device, on a night when the moon was a nail paring above the lagoon. Enzo had been at the bench then too, finishing a set of reading lenses for a Paduan scholar, and he had heard the same sequence: boat, rope, footsteps, door. That night he had allowed himself one glance through the workshop window and had seen the tall man from the storeroom — the thin one in the dark cloak, the one whose face he had never clearly seen — standing with Bardolino on the fondamenta. They had spoken for perhaps ten minutes. The tall man had carried nothing. He had left the way he came, and Bardolino had gone back inside, and in the morning he had stood at the furnace mouth and blown a goblet so fine that the apprentices had stopped to watch, the glass catching the light like a held breath, and he had turned to Enzo and said, "You see? The gather must be alive. If you cannot feel it breathing, you have already lost it."

The second visit, four days later, was different. A different man — shorter, broader, dressed not in a cloak but in the rough wool of a boatman. He had carried a crate. Not large, perhaps the length of Enzo's forearm and half as wide, but heavy enough that the man had shifted his grip twice crossing the fondamenta. Bardolino had unlocked the storeroom — Enzo heard the scrape of the new lock, the groan of the oak door on its iron bands — and the crate had gone in, and the door had closed, and the lock had turned again. The boatman left. Bardolino stood alone on the fondamenta for a long time after, looking out at the dark water, and Enzo had watched him from the shadow of the grinding bench and thought: I know you. I have watched you stand like that a hundred times, looking at the lagoon the way other men look at a woman, with patience and hunger and something I used to think was love.

Now it was the fourth time, or the fifth — he had lost count of the boatman's visits, which came irregularly, though the tall man's arrivals held to a stricter rhythm. Enzo had begun to keep a record. Not written — he did not dare — but held in the architecture of his memory, each night filed and cross-referenced the way his father had taught him to catalogue lenses. Date. Moon phase. Tide. Duration. What was carried. What was said, if he could hear it. What was locked away.

The door closed. The lock turned. Enzo ground the lens.

In the morning Bardolino would test the overnight anneal, and if the pieces had cooled well he would be generous, expansive, standing at the glory hole with his sleeves rolled back and his forearms mapped with old burns, talking about the properties of soda ash and the way manganese could bleach the green from common glass. He would inspect Enzo's grinding and nod — not slowly, not with ceremony, but the way a man nods when the work is correct and there is nothing more to say. He would promise, again, that the master blanks were coming. Soon. When the current commission was finished. His hands would move through the air as he spoke, those hands that Enzo had studied since he was thirteen years old, scarred and enormous and so precise that they could shape a vessel's lip to the thickness of a fingernail. Enzo had wanted those hands to teach him everything.

Now when he saw them he saw them turning the key.

He had not known that knowledge could be a kind of furnace. That it could heat you from the inside until the surface of your life — the good apprentice, the grateful boy, the one who worked late and asked careful questions — became a skin stretched over something molten. Every morning he greeted Bardolino and the greeting was accurate, the right words in the right tone, and every morning the effort of it left him feeling thinner, as though some part of him were being ground away along with the glass.

But he did not rush. A lens ruined by haste was a lens ruined; you could not ungrind it, could not add back what impatience had taken. His father's journal had taught him that much, if it had taught him nothing else. Giacomo Sforno had spent months on the project and had recorded his work with the calm precision of a man who understood that truth was a surface you approached by degrees, checking and rechecking, holding the piece up to the light and turning it until the distortions revealed themselves. Enzo would do the same. He would watch. He would remember. He would not confront Bardolino until he understood the shape of what Bardolino had built.

So the weeks passed. December darkened toward its close. The furnace burned day and night — this was the high season for orders, and the workshop was full from prime to vespers, the apprentices moving in their familiar choreography around the benches and the glory holes and the annealing ovens. Enzo worked among them and was invisible in his diligence. No one watched a boy who was always at his bench. No one questioned a grinding apprentice who stayed late; he had been doing it for years.

At night, alone, he mapped the conspiracy's pulse.

The tall man came on Thursdays. Not every Thursday — he had missed two in the five weeks Enzo had been watching — but when he came, it was Thursday, after compline, and he stayed no longer than the time it took a candle to burn down a finger's width. He never carried anything in. He sometimes carried papers out, folded small, tucked inside his cloak. His boat came from the direction of Venice and returned the same way.

The boatman came without pattern, or with a pattern Enzo had not yet discerned. He always brought crates. The crates varied in size. Once, Enzo heard glass inside one — not the clear ring of finished vessels but the dull, muffled sound of raw material packed in straw. Another time the crate was silent and so heavy that both the boatman and Bardolino carried it together, and when they set it down inside the storeroom something dense and metallic shifted within.

On the night of the Epiphany — the sixth of January, the feast day bright and cold, the lagoon skinned with ice at the shallows — Enzo saw something new. The tall man came at his usual hour, but this time he did not go to the fondamenta. He went to Bardolino's study, the small room off the main workshop where the master kept his accounts and correspondence. Enzo, at the bench, heard their voices through the wall. Still too low to parse. But when the tall man left, passing through the workshop on his way to the door, his cloak swung open for a moment in the draft from the furnace, and Enzo saw what he carried.

A letter. Folded, sealed with red wax. And on the wax, pressed deep and clear in the light of the banked furnace: a device Enzo had seen before. Not on a letter. On a building. The winged lion of San Marco, yes, every seal in Venice bore some version of it — but this one was different. Beneath the lion, a second mark. A small one. A crescent.

He had seen that crescent. His father's journal, the entry for September of the previous year, the one Enzo had read three times and committed to the dark catalog of his memory: *The commission comes not from the Council but from beneath it. Look for the half-moon. G. knows, and G. is afraid.*

Enzo set down the grinding tool. The lens lay on the bench before him, its surface cool now, the emery paste dried to a gray film. His hands were steady. His breath was even. But something in the architecture of his understanding had shifted the way a blank shifts on the wheel when you have ground past the curve's center — a new geometry revealed, precise and irreversible. The conspiracy did not end with Bardolino. It did not end with the tall man or the boatman or the crates locked behind the oak door. It reached into the state itself, into some chamber beneath the chambers Enzo knew, where men marked their letters with a half-moon and the master glassmakers of Murano did what they were told.

He picked up the tool. He began, again, to grind.
