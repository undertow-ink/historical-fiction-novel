The book on the table between them was not the one Enzo had come for, but he let Gritti talk. The bookseller had pulled it from a shelf behind the counter the moment Enzo walked in — a new acquisition, he said, a Pliny copied in a fine Roman hand, and had Enzo seen how the copyist rendered the passages on glass? Gritti's spectacles caught the gray light from the window as he turned pages with the careful speed of a man who touched books the way glassblowers touched pontelli, knowing exactly where the heat lived. Enzo stood across from him and waited. He had learned, in his months of coming here, that Gritti's enthusiasms were like the acqua alta — they rose on their own schedule and receded the same way, and the surest method of passage was patience.

"But you did not come for Pliny," Gritti said. He looked up. His fingers remained on the open page. "You have a question. I can see it."

"I have been thinking about what we discussed," Enzo said. "The speculum urens."

Gritti's hands left the book. He removed his spectacles, polished them on his sleeve, replaced them — the gesture Enzo had come to recognize as the man winding himself like a clock spring. "Bacon's mirror. Yes. A magnificent problem. I have been thinking about it also, if I am honest. I returned to the De multiplicatione specierum after you left last time and I found a passage I had overlooked, or rather not overlooked but failed to connect to the passages in the Opus Majus that deal with — but forgive me, you said you had a question."

"Who could build it?"

Gritti blinked. "Build it."

"You said Bacon described it but never constructed one. You said the glass was not good enough in his time. But cristallo exists now." Enzo kept his voice level, the voice he used when discussing grit sizes or curvatures with customers at the furnace — technical, detached. "If someone wanted to build Bacon's mirror today, using Muranese glass, who would know how? Who among living scholars has the knowledge?"

The bookseller sat down on the stool behind his counter, a motion that in Gritti always preceded a lengthy answer. He laced his fingers over his stomach. The shop was quiet around them — a small space crowded with purpose, every surface bearing books or the instruments of their care, the air thick with the sweetish smell of sized paper and leather and the faint acetone bite of old ink. Through the single window, the sounds of the Rialto reached them thinned and flattened, a market murmur that never fully stopped.

"That is a better question than you perhaps realize," Gritti said. "Because the problem of the speculum urens is not simply optical. It is — how shall I say — it is compound. One must understand Alhazen's geometry of reflection and refraction, yes. One must understand Bacon's proposed applications. But one must also understand glass. The properties of cristallo, its tolerances, the way it behaves under grinding. Most scholars who study optics have never touched a lens blank in their lives. They work from texts. They argue about Alhazen's postulates the way theologians argue about the Trinity — with great passion and no material evidence."

"But some have."

"Some have. A few." Gritti raised a hand and counted on his ink-darkened fingers. "There is Maurolico in Messina, who is doing extraordinary work on the geometry of light. But he is a pure mathematician. He would no more grind a lens than he would shoe a horse. There is old Toscanelli's student in Florence — but Florence is in chaos now, and that school is scattered. There was a very fine Augustinian in Bologna who wrote on burning glasses, but he died in the plague year."

Enzo waited. He had asked the river to flow, and the river was flowing, and somewhere in its course lay the stone he needed.

"The difficulty," Gritti continued, warming now, leaning forward on the stool so that his spectacles slipped and he pushed them back with a forefinger, "the real difficulty is that the men who understand the theory despise the workshop, and the men who understand the workshop have never read Alhazen. It is the great fracture of our age. Bacon saw it — Bacon said that experimental science and mathematical science must be married, that neither alone suffices. But who listens to Bacon? The universities teach from texts. The furnaces teach from practice. The two worlds do not speak."

"But if someone bridged them," Enzo said. "Theory and craft. Someone who had read Alhazen and also worked with glass."

Gritti went still. Not the stillness of a man who had finished speaking but the stillness of a man whose thoughts had arrived somewhere ahead of his mouth. He took off his spectacles again. Without them his eyes looked smaller, softer, oddly exposed.

"There is one man," he said. "Or there was. I have not heard from him in some time."

Enzo said nothing. He kept his hands flat on the counter.

"A Franciscan. Fra Giordano da Padova. We studied under the same masters at the university — not at the same time, he was perhaps ten years after me, but we shared teachers and therefore shared a certain vocabulary, a certain way of approaching these problems. He wrote to me first, in the year of our Lord fourteen hundred and eighty-eight, asking about a passage in the Perspectiva of Witelo that he believed had been incorrectly transcribed in the Paduan copy. A small matter. But from that small matter grew a correspondence, and from the correspondence I came to understand that Fra Giordano was not like the other scholars I knew."

"How so?"

"He built things." Gritti said it the way another man might have said *he walked on water* — with wonder and a faint unease. "He did not merely theorize. He designed instruments. He ground lenses — not well, I think, not with the skill of a trained craftsman, but well enough to test his calculations. He wrote to me once that he had constructed a device using two convex lenses that could concentrate the sun's light to a point sufficient to ignite parchment at a distance of twelve braccia. I confess I was skeptical. But the mathematics he included in his letter were flawless. Elegant, even. He is what Bacon would have been if Bacon had been born in Italy with access to cristallo."

The phrase landed in Enzo's chest like a struck bell. Twelve braccia. The storeroom device had worked at twenty feet with nothing but banked coals and a lattice of lenses that were — he saw it now, the connection clean and cold as a finished surface — that were arranged in the parabolic curve his father's journal had described. The same curve. The same mathematics.

"Where is he now?" Enzo asked.

"That I cannot tell you with certainty. His last letter came from the Franciscan house of Sant'Antonio in Padua. That was — let me think — two years ago. Perhaps slightly more. He wrote to ask whether I could locate a copy of Bacon's Epistola de secretis operibus, the one that discusses military applications. I found one. I wrote to tell him. He never replied." Gritti spread his hands. "I assumed he had entered a stricter observance, or been sent to another house. Franciscans move. It is their nature. Foxes have holes, and so forth."

"Did he ever come to Venice?"

"Not to my knowledge. But he came to Murano." Gritti said this casually, the way he said everything, without weight or suspicion, a man for whom information existed to be shared. "He mentioned in one of his earlier letters that he had visited the glassworks twice. To study the properties of cristallo directly, he said. To observe the processes of annealing and grinding. He was very interested in the furnaces — in how the heat could be controlled, how different compositions of the batch produced different refractive qualities. He asked me once if I knew any maestri who might allow a Franciscan to observe their work. I gave him a name or two. I cannot remember whose."

The shop felt smaller. The light from the window had shifted as a cloud moved, and the books on the near shelf threw long shadows across the counter. Enzo's hands had not moved. His breathing had not changed. But the name echoed in a chamber deeper than hearing — *G. knows, and G. is afraid* — and he understood now what the letter G had meant in his father's journal. Not a family name. Not a Venetian surname. Giordano. Fra Giordano, who had come to Murano to study glass, who had corresponded with booksellers about Bacon's military treatises, who had stopped writing letters two years ago. The same year Enzo's father had stopped breathing.

"His treatise," Enzo said. "The one on military optics. Could I read it?"

Gritti shook his head. "It circulated only in manuscript, among a small group. Five or six copies at most. Fra Giordano was not a man who sought publication. He was, I think, aware that the Church might take an unkind view of a friar who wrote about weapons, even theoretical ones. I had a letter in which he quoted extensively from it — the sections on parabolic reflection, on the concentration of rays through compound lenses — but the treatise itself I never held."

"And the men he corresponded with. Do you know who they were?"

"Scholars, mostly. The men I mentioned. Maurolico received a copy, I believe. A professor in Bologna whose name escapes me. Perhaps one or two others." Gritti paused. He picked up his spectacles again, turned them in his hands as though examining his own lenses for flaws. "You know, it occurs to me that I never asked Fra Giordano who commissioned his research. He was very specific in his questions, very directed — not the way a man pursues idle scholarship but the way a man works toward a practical end. Someone was paying for his materials, his travel. Franciscans take vows of poverty. They do not fund their own experiments."

"No," Enzo said. "They do not."

The bookseller looked at him with mild curiosity, the expression of a man who senses a current beneath the surface but has no instinct for depths. "Why this interest, young Sforno? Has Maestro Bardolino set you some new problem?"

"Only the old ones," Enzo said. "Curvature and grit."

Gritti laughed. "The eternal problems. Well, if you wish to pursue the matter further, I will look through my papers. I may still have Fra Giordano's letters. They would be in the cabinet with my Paduan correspondence — assuming I filed them correctly, which is never a certainty in this shop." He gestured at the cheerful disorder surrounding them. "Come back in a week. I will see what I can find."

Enzo thanked him. He bought a small thing — a pamphlet on some nautical matter he would never read — because he always bought something, because a young man who came only to ask questions would eventually produce questions about the young man. He stepped out into the afternoon. The Rialto crowds pressed around him, faces and cloaks and the smell of fish and damp wool, the canal beyond them flat and gray beneath the February sky.

He had the designer's name. Fra Giordano da Padova, who had come to Murano, who had studied the furnaces, who had written the diagrams now locked behind Bardolino's oak door. He had the manufacturer: Bardolino himself, grinding the lenses his apprentice's father had refused to grind. He had the half-moon seal, the letters that passed between Venice and Murano on Thursday nights.

What he did not have was the patron. The one who paid. The one whose seal bore the crescent beneath the lion. The one who operated in some chamber beneath the chambers Enzo knew, where the state's business became something other than the state's business. Fra Giordano was the mind. Bardolino was the hands. But the will — the money and the purpose and the power to kill a man who refused — that belonged to someone Enzo had not yet seen, someone whose face was hidden the way a furnace's hottest core was hidden, visible only by what it produced.

He crossed the bridge. The yellow circle on his chest caught the wind as his cloak opened. He pulled it shut and walked north, toward the traghetto that would carry him back across the water to Murano, to the furnace, to the grinding bench where he would sit beside the man who had murdered his father and work in silence until he understood enough to act.
