The stone floor of San Donato was colder than the air outside, and Enzo felt it through the soles of his shoes the moment he stepped past the narthex. February light came through the windows in pale columns that did not warm what they touched. The nave was empty. He could hear water somewhere — not the canal outside but something dripping within the walls themselves, as though the church remembered that it stood on a lagoon.

He had come straight from the traghetto landing, his cloak still damp at the hem from spray. The yellow circle on his doublet was visible, and he had considered, on the boat, whether to pull the cloak across it. He had not. A boy who hid things drew attention. A boy who walked openly into a church, his mark displayed, was merely odd — an apprentice with a question, perhaps, or a curious youth who had wandered in from the campo.

The apse mosaic stopped him.

He had seen it before, years ago, standing beside his father in this same nave during a guild ceremony that Giacomo had attended as Bardolino's guest. He had been twelve, and the mosaic had been merely large and gold and vaguely frightening — the Virgin floating in her field of tessera like something that could see through walls. Now he was seventeen, and he had ground glass for three years, and he saw it differently.

The tessera were glass. Each one. Thousands of small squares cut from canes of colored glass and pressed into plaster — blue for the Virgin's robe, a red so deep it was nearly black for the border panels, white for her hands and face. And the gold: not gold at all but glass backed with gold leaf, each tessera a tiny sandwich of clear glass, metal, and colored glass fused in a furnace not so different from Bardolino's. The gold caught what little light reached the apse and held it, amplified it, bent it back toward the nave so that the Virgin appeared to glow from within. She was lit not by divinity but by the same principle Enzo used every day at the grinding bench — the manipulation of how light moved through and across glass surfaces.

The craftsmen who made this had understood refraction. They had understood it six hundred years ago, without Alhazen's mathematics, without Bacon's diagrams. They had learned it the way Enzo's father had — by watching light pass through molten material and paying attention to what it did.

Glass in service of the divine. The thought formed clearly, and behind it, like a shadow thrown on a wall by a candle placed too close, the other thought: glass in service of burning. The same silica, the same fire, the same craft of shaping how light behaved. The tessera caught light and spread it across a wall to make men believe they stood in the presence of God. The device in the storeroom caught light and focused it to a point so hot it could ignite wood. The material did not choose. The craftsman chose.

His father had chosen. And his father was dead.

A sound from the south aisle — the rhythmic scrape of straw on stone. Enzo turned. A friar was sweeping near the side altar, working with the unhurried strokes of a man who swept the same floor every day and no longer thought about it. He was of medium height, thin at the shoulders but soft at the waist in the way of men who sat more than they stood. His tonsure was freshly cut, the ring of remaining hair a light brown. His robe was clean but mended at the hem with thread that did not quite match.

The friar looked up. He did not startle. His face arranged itself into an expression of mild, genuine welcome — the face of a man who liked being interrupted.

"Good afternoon," the friar said. He leaned the broom against the altar rail. "Can I help you?"

"I hope so, Frate." Enzo crossed the nave toward him. The yellow circle was visible. The friar's eyes moved to it, registered it, and returned to Enzo's face without any change in expression. "My name is Enzo Sforno. I am an apprentice on the island — at Bardolino's furnace."

"Ah." The friar nodded. "I am Frate Silvestro. You grind lenses, then? Bardolino's shop produces fine work."

"You know the furnaces."

"I know all the furnaces," Silvestro said, and something in his voice suggested that this was both a point of pride and a gentle complaint. "The glassmakers are my parishioners. I baptize their children and bury their fathers and listen to their troubles when the Council of Ten changes the export regulations. Sit, please. There is a bench."

There was. A stone bench set into the wall beneath a window that let in a rectangle of gray-white sky. Enzo sat. The stone was as cold as the floor. Silvestro settled beside him with the ease of a man who spent much of his day sitting with people on benches.

"I have been thinking about the history of glass on Murano," Enzo said. It was not entirely a lie. "The mosaic — I was looking at the tessera. The gold-leaf technique."

"Beautiful, is it not?" Silvestro glanced toward the apse. "Twelfth century. The masters who made it came from Constantinople, or so the story goes. They brought the gold-leaf method with them." He paused. "You look at it like a craftsman."

"I am a craftsman."

"Yes. But most apprentices your age look at it and see the Virgin. You see the glass."

Enzo said nothing. The observation was too precise to answer safely.

"It is not a criticism," Silvestro said. His voice was warm. "God made the glass as well as the Virgin. There is no sin in admiring the material." He folded his hands in his lap. "What is it you wish to know about the history?"

"I have been reading about optics," Enzo said. "The science of light and lenses. Some of it written by men of your order — Franciscans. Roger Bacon, for one." He watched Silvestro's face. "I wondered whether any scholars have come to Murano to study the glassmaking. Men who are interested in how glass shapes light."

Silvestro's hands shifted in his lap. His right thumb pressed against the knuckle of his left. A small motion, barely visible, but Enzo had spent months watching men's hands around furnaces and grinding benches, and he noticed.

"There have been scholars, yes," Silvestro said. "From time to time. The University of Padua sends men occasionally — natural philosophers interested in the properties of glass. The island's reputation draws them."

"Anyone in particular? A friar, perhaps?"

The thumb pressed harder. Silvestro looked toward the apse again, but this time his gaze did not settle on the mosaic. It passed over it and fixed on something beyond — the wall, perhaps, or something that was not in the church at all.

"There is a brother," Silvestro said. "Fra Giordano. From Padua. He has visited several times over the past years to study the craft. A very learned man. Very —" He paused. The word he chose was careful. "Dedicated."

"To optics?"

"To the science of light, yes. And to the practical applications of that science. He is interested in lenses, mirrors, the behavior of reflected and refracted light." Silvestro spoke with the fluency of a man repeating things he had been told, not things he understood from his own study. "He is a brother of my order, and I have been glad to offer him hospitality when he visits."

"He stays with you?"

"He has. He stayed here for ten days in — let me think — September. Perhaps October. The heat had only just broken." Silvestro's voice had lost some of its warmth. Not all. But enough that Enzo heard the difference, the way a grinder hears a change in the pitch of emery against glass that tells him the surface has shifted beneath the paste. "He is a brilliant man. Truly. His knowledge of Bacon's work is extraordinary. But he asks questions about the furnaces that only a craftsman would know to ask."

"What sort of questions?"

"About temperatures. About the purity of different batches of silica. About the methods for casting flat glass in large pieces. About polishing." Silvestro turned back to Enzo. His face still held its habitual kindness, but his eyes were searching now — trying, Enzo thought, to understand why a seventeen-year-old apprentice was asking these things. "He writes to certain masters on the island. I do not know which ones. He does not tell me, and I do not ask. He is a brother of my order, and his work is his own."

The silence that followed was not uncomfortable. Silvestro was a man accustomed to silence, and Enzo used the moment to fit the new pieces against the ones he already held. Fra Giordano visited Murano. He asked craftsmen's questions. He corresponded with masters — Bardolino, almost certainly. He had been here in the autumn, months before the device in the storeroom was assembled. And Silvestro, who had housed him and shared meals with him, spoke of his brilliance with the careful tone of a man who admired a fire but did not wish to stand too close to it.

"Does he visit often?" Enzo asked.

"Two or three times each year. Sometimes more." Silvestro hesitated. "He is not an easy man to know. His mind moves quickly, and he does not always remember that others move more slowly. But he is devout. He prays at length. He keeps his offices." This last was said as though it settled something, and perhaps for Silvestro it did. A man who prayed could be trusted. The world was simple in that way, if you were a Franciscan who swept the floors of San Donato and baptized the children of glassmakers.

"Thank you, Frate," Enzo said. He stood. "You have been very kind."

"You are welcome here," Silvestro said. He said it with deliberate emphasis, and his eyes went once more to the yellow circle on Enzo's doublet. "The church is open to all who come with honest purpose. Remember that."

Enzo thanked him again and walked back through the nave. The mosaic watched him go — the Virgin in her gold field, her eyes flat and dark and made of glass, her radiance engineered by craftsmen who had known exactly how to place each tessera so that the light would fall the way they wished. They had built an illusion of holiness from silica and gold leaf and the physics of reflection, and it had endured for three hundred years.

He stepped through the west door into the campo. The afternoon had thickened toward evening, and the sky over Murano was the color of raw ash. To his left, the canal. To his right, the rooftops and, above them, the chimneys of the furnaces — Bardolino's among them — sending their thin columns of smoke into the low cloud. The air smelled of salt and sulfur and the particular mineral sharpness of burned sand.

He had the designer now. Fra Giordano da Padova, who came to Murano to study the glass, who wrote to certain masters, who asked questions about temperatures and polishing and the casting of flat glass in large pieces. Giordano drew the plans. Bardolino built the device. His father had ground the lenses, and when his father refused to grind more, his father had died in a furnace that should not have exploded.

Two figures. Not enough.

A device like the one behind the oak door required more than a friar's obsession and a glassmaker's skill. It required money — the kind of money that bought silence, that paid for boatmen and locks and crates shipped in darkness. It required a patron with the power to commission a weapon and the purpose to use it. Someone who sealed letters with a half-moon. Someone who moved through chambers beneath the chambers Enzo knew.

The furnace chimneys smoked against the gray sky. Behind him, through the church walls, the gold tessera held the last of the light.
