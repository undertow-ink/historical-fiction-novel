The smell of the fish hit him thirty paces before the stalls. Enzo shifted the sack of manganese powder to his left shoulder and pressed through the crowd with the other, the coarse linen of his sleeve already damp from the bodies around him. He had come for bone ash — Bardolino needed three measures for the lattimo batch — and the dealer on the far side of the Rialto kept the cleanest supply, calcined twice and ground fine as flour.

A porter's elbow caught him in the ribs. He turned sideways and let the man pass, a crate of live eels balanced on his head, water dripping from the slats onto the worn planks of the bridge. The wood under Enzo's feet had been polished by ten thousand crossings a day until it shone like something almost precious. He could feel it through his thin soles, smooth and slightly giving, the whole structure swaying with the weight of the crowd.

He was halfway across when he saw him.

The recognition came not to his mind but to his body — a contraction beneath the sternum, the same tightening he felt when he pulled a blowpipe from the glory hole and the gather was too hot, too bright, a warning that preceded thought. His hand closed on the edge of the sack. His feet stopped.

Twenty paces ahead, moving against the flow of traffic with a kind of unhurried precision, a man in a dark silk doublet. Lean. The same height. The same narrow set of the shoulders that Enzo had watched from behind a stack of crates on the dock at Bardolino's furnace, three times now — no, four — always at night, always arriving by private gondola with the felze curtains drawn, always entering the storeroom where the locked cabinet stood, always leaving before the second bell.

But there had never been enough light. The torches on the dock threw long shadows and the man kept his face turned from them, and Enzo, pressed against the damp brick of the storehouse wall, had seen only the shape of him — the silk, the movement, the way he stepped from the gondola without offering his hand to the boatman, as though he had calculated the distance and his own balance so precisely that help was an insult.

Now the sun was on him.

The man moved through the crowd the way a needle moves through cloth — the fabric parting, closing again behind, no tear, no disruption. Vendors stepped aside without seeming to notice they had done so. A spice merchant with a tray of pepper twists pivoted at the last moment, giving way, and the man passed without breaking stride. His doublet was dark — not black but the deepest brown, the color of the canal at midnight — and cut close to the body, no excess of fabric, nothing to catch or billow. The silk had a matte finish, expensive but refusing to declare itself. A man dressed not to impress but to pass through.

Enzo lowered the sack to the railing and leaned there as though resting. His pulse was in his throat.

The man had paused at a cloth merchant's stall. He was not browsing. He was speaking to someone — a shorter man in a red cap, a factor or secretary, who held a ledger and nodded as he received instructions. The man in dark silk spoke without gestures. His hands were still at his sides. On the right hand, a single gold ring, plain, catching the light once and then not again as he shifted his weight.

Enzo had spent his life reading heat by color, reading the state of molten glass by the way it moved on the pipe, reading the moment when a gather was ready to shape by a visceral recognition that lived in his hands and his belly rather than his mind. He read this man the same way. The dark hair, oiled and combed back from the forehead. The face narrow, clean-shaven, the bones close under the skin. The eyes — he could not see their color from this distance, but he could see that they moved seldom and rested long. There was a mark along the left jaw, fine as a crack in a finished piece, the kind of scar that could have come from a blade held very close by someone who either loved or hated him.

The Silk. The name arrived whole, the way the best glass came off the pipe — not built but revealed, as though it had been there inside the gather all along, waiting for the air.

"You buying or leaning?"

Enzo turned. A fishmonger's boy, twelve or thirteen, was staring at him from behind a display of sardines laid out in silver rows on a bed of salt.

"Neither," Enzo said.

"Then move your sack. You're blocking my customers."

Enzo moved the sack. He stayed at the railing.

The man in the red cap had gone. The Silk stood alone at the edge of the cloth stall, his gaze passing over the bridge with the slow sweep of someone surveying territory rather than searching for anything in particular. For a moment his eyes crossed the place where Enzo stood, and Enzo felt the passage of that gaze the way he felt a draft across the workshop — a cooling, a change in the air, brief and impersonal and gone.

He did not think the man had seen him. Not truly seen. To the Silk, he would be what he was — a young man in a worn tunic with a yellow circle stitched to his chest, carrying supplies, one of the hundreds who crossed the Rialto every morning on errands from Murano. Beneath notice. Which was, Enzo thought, the first useful thing the yellow circle had ever done for him.

A voice from the neighboring stall, loud and familiar in the way of men who sell the same goods in the same place for twenty years, called out to a passing customer: "Ser Viaro! Ser Viaro, I have the civet you asked for, arrived Tuesday from Alexandria — "

The Silk did not turn. He raised one hand, a small precise motion, and the perfumer fell silent and waited. Then the Silk walked to him — three steps, no more — and leaned close, and said something that Enzo could not hear. The perfumer nodded, wrapped a small vial in cloth, and passed it across. No coins changed hands. An account, then. A man with accounts at the Rialto.

Ser Viaro.

Enzo pressed the name into his memory the way he pressed a seal into hot wax. He watched the man take the vial and slip it into a pocket cut inside the doublet — a tailor's detail, invisible from the outside. Viaro. He would need the rest. The family, the position, the house. But the name was the handle, and the handle was enough to grip.

A Dalmatian merchant pushed past with a bolt of rough wool over his shoulder, shouting for clearance in a dialect Enzo only half understood. When the path cleared, the Silk had moved on, heading north along the bank toward the Fabbriche Vecchie, where the state offices kept their ledgers and the clerks of the Salt Magistracy and the customs house sat behind their narrow windows. Enzo watched the way the crowd received him — not parting in deference, not exactly, but adjusting, the way water adjusts around a piling, a constant, unconscious acknowledgment of something solid in the stream.

A man with an account at the Rialto perfumer's. A man whose name the vendors knew. A man who moved through the commercial heart of Venice with the unhurried ease of someone who did not need to buy or sell because his business was of a different kind.

Enzo thought of what he knew. The visits to Bardolino's dock. The locked storeroom. The sealed letter with the half-moon pressed into the wax — the crescent his father's journal had warned of, the mark of a commission that came not from the Council but from beneath it. He thought of Fra Giordano's drawings, precise as geometry, detailing a system of compounded lenses and angled mirrors that could concentrate sunlight to a burning point. He thought of the device in Bardolino's storeroom, the brass housing and the lens array he had seen on the workbench, built for a purpose no glassmaker on Murano had been asked to serve before.

And now a name. A patrician's name. A man who walked toward the state offices as though he belonged there.

He picked up the sack of manganese powder. The bone ash dealer was waiting. There were errands to finish and a traghetto to catch and a grinding bench to return to, and Bardolino would notice if he was late. He could not afford to be noticed. Not now.

He moved with the crowd, letting it carry him toward the far end of the bridge, and as he walked he turned the name over the way he turned a pontil in his hand — slowly, examining it from every angle, feeling for the flaw or the strength in it.

Viaro. The Silk had a name.

And the name reached upward, past the furnace, past the friar, past the storeroom with its locked cabinet, into the stone offices where the Republic kept its secrets and conducted the business it did not inscribe in any public register. His father had written: *Look for the half-moon.* His father had known. Had known and been killed before he could say more.

The wooden bridge groaned under the weight of the morning crowd. Below, on the Grand Canal, a barge loaded with timber from the mainland scraped against a mooring post, and the sound was like a door opening — slow, heavy, and impossible to close again.

Enzo pulled his cloak shut over the yellow circle and descended into the market.
