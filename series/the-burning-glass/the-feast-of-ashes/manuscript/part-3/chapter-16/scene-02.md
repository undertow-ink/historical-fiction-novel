A hand caught his sleeve.

Enzo turned too fast, his weight shifting to the balls of his feet before the rest of him decided what to do, and the man standing at his elbow raised both palms and laughed.

"Peace, peace. I did not mean to startle you." Carlo Rossetti held up the offending hand — the one that had touched Enzo's arm — and made a small show of surrender. "You looked as though you were watching a miracle. Or a hanging. In Venice, I suppose, the crowd is the same."

The Rialto pressed around them. A boy with a basket of dried squid shouldered past, and the smell of it — salt and iodine and something sweetly rank — displaced the pepper and cinnamon that hung in the air near the spice merchants' stalls. Behind Rossetti, the Grand Canal threw light against the underside of the bridge, pale gold broken and reassembled by the chop of passing boats.

Enzo lowered his shoulders. He had not realized they were raised.

"Signore Rossetti."

"Carlo. Please. We are beyond formalities, you and I — you have eaten my figs." The smile came easily, creasing the skin at the corners of his dark eyes, and Enzo felt the tightness in his chest loosen by a degree. Rossetti looked the same as he had in June: the good wool doublet, brown and well-cut, the rosary at his belt, the short black beard trimmed close. His cloak was heavier now — lined, Enzo thought, against the March wind that came off the water with a blade in it.

He fell into step beside Enzo as though they had arranged to walk together, and Enzo, who had been standing rigid and visible in the middle of the Rialto staring at a man he should not have been staring at, was grateful for the motion. Moving was safer than standing still.

"Trade has been good this spring," Rossetti said. "The League against the French has opened purses all across the Veneto — everyone buying while they can, before the war closes the passes. The Germans at the Fondaco cannot buy fast enough — silk, glass, pepper. I think they eat the pepper." He shook his head. "Even in Ragusa they are talking about how much money is moving through Venice."

The crowd thinned as they passed the fish market, where the morning's commerce had peaked and the fishmongers were salting what remained. A gull stood on a marble slab among the unsold sardines, pulling at something with the patience of a diner who has nowhere else to be. Rossetti watched it.

"In Constantinople," he said, "there is a story about a gull and a fisherman. Every morning the gull steals the best fish before the fisherman can sell it. So the fisherman says, 'Why do you take only the best?' And the gull says, 'Because I can tell the difference.'" He glanced at Enzo. "The moral, I believe, is that good taste is a kind of theft."

Enzo did not laugh, but the corners of his mouth eased. Rossetti had a way of talking that assumed you were already his friend and that friendship was a small, obvious thing requiring no negotiation.

"You have not come to the furnace," Enzo said.

"No. Your Maestro Bardolino sent word that visitors were not possible at present. A polite refusal." Rossetti raised one hand. "A man who guards his craft is a man whose craft is worth guarding. But I confess I have been buying pieces from every stall on the Fondamenta, and each time I turn a goblet in my hands I think: if only the boy who reads glass like scripture would tell me what I am holding."

The flattery was visible, set in the open — and yet there was something real in it, a genuine hunger to understand that Enzo had noticed in June and noticed again now. Rossetti's hands moved as he spoke, and Enzo saw again what he had seen before: the calluses on the right hand, thick and placed wrong. Not a merchant's calluses. Not a craftsman's. The roughened skin sat along the edge of the palm and across the base of the forefinger, in places where Enzo had no frame of reference to explain what had made them.

He did not ask. A flaw in the surface that might mean nothing, or might mean the piece was built around a hidden stress.

Near the Campo San Giacomo, Rossetti bought two oranges from a woman with a cart and offered Enzo half without ceremony. The fruit was sweet and sharp, the juice cold on his tongue.

"I saw you standing back there," Rossetti said. He ate a section, his eyes on the crowd. "Before I came up. You were watching someone."

Enzo's fingers tightened on the orange. The juice ran between his knuckles.

"The market," he said. "I was looking at the market."

"Of course. But your face —" Rossetti made a small gesture near his own jaw, a tightening. "You had the face of a man who has seen a price he cannot pay." He ate another section. "Forgive me. It is a habit. I read faces the way you read glass — for the flaws, for where the stress sits." He smiled. "And I am often wrong. My last partner in Ragusa told me I see meaning in clouds."

Enzo ate the orange. The acid bit at a small cut on his lip. Around them, the Rialto moved — a porter arguing with a gondolier, two women sorting secondhand linen, a Franciscan friar walking with his hands clasped behind his back. All of it ordinary. And across the campo, gone now into whatever corridor of the Republic's business had produced him, the man in dark silk who visited Bardolino's furnace on Thursday nights and sealed his letters with a half-moon beneath the lion.

Viaro. The name the perfumer had called across the stalls an hour ago — *Ser Viaro* — and then, at a banking table nearby, a factor to his clerk: *There goes Viaro. The Council must be working them hard.* Two sentences overheard in the noise of the market. A name and a destination.

"That one, for instance," Rossetti said.

Enzo looked at him.

"The one in the dark silk. You were watching him, I think." The voice had not changed. The same easy warmth, the same conversational weight — a man remarking on the weather or the price of saffron. "Is he a customer of yours? He seemed to take an interest in the glass stalls. I saw him stop at Moretto's."

The orange was finished. Enzo held the peel and felt the oil on his fingertips.

"I do not know him," he said.

"Ah." Rossetti tossed his own peel toward a gutter and watched a pigeon investigate it. "He has the look of a man who knows things. In Ragusa we call them *i silenziosi* — the silent ones. They never shout at the market, never argue over a price. They simply appear, and things are arranged." He dusted his hands. "But I know nothing. As I said — I see meaning in clouds."

He clapped Enzo on the shoulder, brief and warm, and the contact sent a small shock through Enzo's arm — not from its force but from its ease. The yellow circle sat visible on Enzo's chest, and Rossetti's hand had landed beside it without flinching, without the fractional hesitation Enzo had learned to detect in every Venetian who came close enough to read the badge. It was not that Rossetti did not see it. He saw everything — the glass, the faces, the man in silk. He simply did not reorganize himself around it.

"I must go. The Fondaco waits, and the Germans are difficult when they have been kept waiting — they take it as a kind of war." He pressed his hands together and gave a small, slightly theatrical bow. "Come find me when you are next at the Rialto. I owe you a box of Smyrna figs."

He turned and was gone — the brown doublet disappearing among the darker cloaks, the way a stone dropped into the canal vanishes without disturbing the surface. Enzo looked down at the orange peel in his hand, creased where his grip had tightened.

Rossetti's question turned in him. *Is he a customer of yours?* The kind of thing a glass trader would ask. And yet the question had been precise in the way a lens was precise — ground to a specific curvature, aimed at a specific point. Not "who is that man?" Not "do you know him?" But *is he a customer* — a question that assumed a connection between Viaro and the glass trade and waited to see what image formed.

He filed it away. It sat beside other things he had filed — the calluses on Rossetti's hand, the way the man moved through crowds without touching anyone, the accent that thickened and thinned as though the voice itself were testing which register to wear. None of it assembled into meaning. Not yet.

What assembled was something else.

He dropped the peel and walked toward the traghetto landing. The sack of manganese knocked against his hip with each step. The bridge receded. The noise thinned. And in the thinning, as the market's roar became the quieter slap of canal water against stone, the morning's knowledge reorganized itself with the cold clarity of a lens settling into its housing.

Viaro was not a private agent. The factor at the banking table had said it without thinking, the way men say things they consider common knowledge: *the Council must be working them hard.* The Council. The Ten. The body that governed Venice's intelligence, its secret diplomacy, its wars both visible and hidden. The body whose agents sealed their correspondence beneath the winged lion with a half-moon.

The device in Bardolino's storeroom was not a private commission. It was state work. The Republic itself had commissioned a weapon that focused light into fire, and it was being built on Murano, in a furnace where Enzo ground lenses every day, by a master who had taken in a dead man's son and set him to finishing the dead man's work.

His father had refused. And the state had killed him, or the state's agent had killed him, or the state had looked away while its agent arranged an accident in a furnace that should not have exploded. The distinction did not matter. Giacomo Sforno was dead, and the power behind his death was not a man but a machine — the same machine that recalled galleys and posted edicts and consumed what it needed and discarded what it did not.

Enzo reached the traghetto landing and stepped into the farther boat. The hull rocked. He sat. The boatman pushed off.

He pressed his hands together in his lap and discovered they were shaking. Not with cold — the morning was mild, the water smooth enough to hold the reflection of passing clouds. His hands shook because the knowledge in them had changed, and the body understood before the mind had finished, the way a crucible knows its own breaking point an instant before it cracks. He laced his fingers together and held them still and watched Murano grow larger across the water, the furnace chimneys rising against the gray, and each chimney trailed its thread of smoke, and the smoke did not care what burned beneath it.
