The ledger was open to the wrong page. Enzo saw it as he came through the door of the counting room — the column of figures visible in the canal light, soda ash prices running down the left margin in Serena's neat hand, but the dates were October, five months old, and Serena did not look at old numbers. She looked at the numbers that were moving.

She sat behind the table on the same stool, the same window throwing its rippled light across the same narrow room. But the light was different. March light, thin and hard after the winter, and it found her differently than it had in September — sharper on the planes of her face, less kind to the shadows beneath her eyes. The glass-bead necklace at her throat held a new color among the others, a deep amber bead her father must have added since autumn.

"You are early for someone who did not send word he was coming," she said.

She did not look up. Her quill moved along a margin. The strand of hair that always came loose from her braid hung along her jaw, and her sleeves were pushed past her elbows, and the ink stain was on her third finger where it always was. Six months since he had stood in this doorway, and she had not rearranged herself for his absence.

"I came from the Rialto," he said.

"Sit down."

He sat. The table between them was covered with ledgers and loose pages and a brass scale for weighing coin, and beside the scale a crust of bread she had not finished. The room smelled of ink and canal water and the permanent scent of furnace smoke that lived in every surface on Murano.

"The soda ash from Alicante has stopped coming," Serena said. She turned a page. "Three weeks now. My father says it is the weather. It is not the weather."

"What is it?"

"War. The French hold the southern routes. No Catalan captain will risk the passage with French galleys off Sardinia. So we pay twice the price for Levantine ash, and the suppliers know we have no choice, so they raise it again." Her quill tapped the column. "Here. And here. February prices."

Enzo looked at the figures. The numbers were clean and precise and meaningless to him. The shapes on the page would not resolve into quantities, because behind them, behind everything, the crescent seal burned in his mind the way a bright light burns behind closed lids — present even in the dark, even when you turn away.

"Enzo."

He looked up. She had stopped writing. The quill rested in its groove, and her hands were flat on the ledger, and she was looking at him with the focus he had seen twice before in this room — the narrowed attention she gave to numbers that did not add up, to a column that should balance and did not.

"What happened at the Rialto?"

"Nothing," he said.

The canal light shifted on the wall behind her — a slow ripple, the tide turning beneath the window — and in that moving light the freckles across her nose and cheeks stood out against her skin like flecks of color in a glass that has not been fully mixed, each one distinct, each one precisely where it had been six months ago.

"Your hands are doing what they do when you are lying," she said.

He looked down. His right thumb was moving across the calluses of his left fingers, back and forth, the grinding pattern, the unconscious motion he had never been able to stop. He stilled them. Placed both hands flat on the table. The yellow circle on his doublet was between them, bright in the canal light, the stitching visible where his mother had sewn it — small, even stitches, the work of a woman who sewed other people's linen for a living and could not bring herself to do poor work even on a badge of shame.

"It is not nothing," Serena said. "Do not insult me."

The room was very small. He had forgotten how small. The table took most of it, and the shelves behind her took the rest, and the window was the only opening, and the canal outside was the only world, and between the two of them the distance was the width of an account book, no more.

"I cannot tell you," he said.

"I know."

"It is not that I do not—"

"I know." She said it the same way both times — level, certain, the voice of a woman who had decided something before she spoke. "You do not have to tell me what it is. I have been watching this island for seventeen years. I watch what comes in and what goes out. I know what Bardolino's furnace has been buying and what it has stopped buying and what arrives after dark on boats without lanterns." Her voice did not change. Her eyes did not leave his. "You do not have to tell me. I am telling you."

She knew. Not the whole shape. Not the names. But the pattern — she had seen it in her ledgers, in the supply orders and the missing invoices and the deliveries that did not match any commission on the guild books. She had read the conspiracy the way she read the market: not by what was declared but by what was absent.

He opened his mouth. Closed it. The bread crust sat on the table between them, and the brass scale, and the ledgers, and outside the window the canal moved in its ancient channel, and the light fell across the table where his hands lay flat and still.

Her hand moved.

Not quickly. Not with the hesitance of someone testing a surface that might give way. She reached across the open ledger and placed her hand over his left hand, and her palm was warm and dry and callused where the quill sat, and the pressure was firm, and she did not look away from his face as she did it.

The yellow circle was visible between their arms. Neither of them looked at it. It was there the way the canal was there, the way the furnace smoke was there — a fact of the world they lived in, present and unmentioned, the third body in every room they had ever shared.

His lungs stopped. The air simply would not move. Her fingers curled over his knuckles, and the warmth of her skin was specific and complete — the ridge of callus at the base of her forefinger, the rough edge of her thumbnail where she had cut it too short, the particular dry heat of a hand that spent its hours gripping quills and turning pages. He knew these hands. He had catalogued them months ago across this same table, reading them the way he read the surface of a lens, and now they were on his skin, and the distance that had held between them since September — the half pace on the fondamenta, the width of a ledger, the space where neither of them stepped — was gone.

Outside the window a barge passed, its hull knocking against the fondamenta stones, and the sound was ordinary, and everything inside the room was not.

He breathed.

One breath. Her hand stayed. The dark amber bead at her throat caught the canal light and held it, and he did not look away from her eyes, which were the color of the lagoon at the place where depth begins — not green and not brown but the thing that both of those colors become when you stop trying to name them.

She withdrew her hand. She picked up the quill. She turned back to the column of figures that mapped the price of soda ash from Alicante, and her head bent over the page, and the strand of hair fell along her jaw, and her hand moved across the paper in the steady rhythm of a woman who was writing numbers.

He stood. He pulled the stool back from the table. The room was the same room it had been when he entered — narrow, cluttered, lit by a single window that faced a canal — and it was a different room entirely, the way a lens is the same glass before and after grinding but the light that passes through it falls in a different place.

"The Levantine ash," he said. His voice sounded strange to him, as if it were coming from a distance. "Your father should buy now, before the price moves again."

"I know," she said. She did not look up. "I already told him."

He walked out through the Contarini workshop, past the men at the annealing oven who worked without haste, into the daylight of the fondamenta. The canal was bright with March sun. Barges moved. Smoke rose from the chimneys. The world was conducting its ordinary business, the same business it had conducted an hour before, when his hand had been only his hand, and hers had been only hers.

He walked south toward the Bardolino furnace, and the yellow circle was on his chest, and the air smelled of salt and ash and the coming spring, and on the back of his left hand the warmth of her palm remained, specific as a burn, in the precise place where she had laid it down.
