The brass lock gave under the pick with less resistance than he had expected, a single clean click like a knuckle cracking. Enzo held the door and listened. Nothing from the calle outside, nothing from the upper floors where Bardolino and Caterina slept with the shutters drawn against the April damp. Only the furnace behind him, its low exhalation through the bocche, the tick of brick surrendering the day's heat into the dark.

He stepped inside.

The storeroom smelled of straw and dust and something sharper underneath — the metallic bite of brass filings, ground so fine they hung in the air like a memory of work. His hands knew the space before his eyes caught up. The first crate was nearest the door, its lid nailed but loose at one corner where someone had pried it before. He reached in through the gap and felt straw, then the curved surface beneath, cool and impossibly smooth, the way water feels just before it moves.

He drew the lens out with both hands. It was heavier than the blanks he ground each day at the bench, heavier and wider across than the span of his fingers — a disc of cristallo as broad as a serving plate, one face flat, the other worked into a curve that his thumbs recognized. Parabolic. The geometry Fra Giordano had sketched in those drawings on vellum, the ones Enzo had seen pinned to the wall above the strongbox in this same room three weeks ago, before Bardolino changed the lock again.

He carried it to the workbench and set it down.

In the glow from the banked coals, the lens gathered what little light there was and bent it. A smear of amber crawled across the scarred wood, distorted, elongated — the furnace's dying eye refracted through twenty-five centimeters of glass that had no business existing on Murano. No spectacle maker needed a lens this size. No optician in the Veneto, no scholar in Padua. This was something else. This had always been something else, and he had ground its edges true with his own hands, morning after morning, while Bardolino watched and said nothing and passed him the finer abrasive when the time came.

Enzo sat on the stool and placed his palms flat on either side of the lens and waited.

The furnace ticked. A coal shifted somewhere in the firebox with a soft crunching sound, and a brief tongue of flame licked through the nearest bocca, throwing his shadow long across the grinding bench and the tool racks and the marver where the day's work had been cleared away. Then it subsided, and the dark settled back like silt in a canal after a boat has passed.

He did not know what hour it was. Late enough that the other furnaces along the fondamenta had gone quiet, their own fires banked or doused, their workers home or in the taverns near San Donato. The whole island seemed to breathe in its sleep, the kilns cooling in sequence like a row of old men nodding off. Through the high window above his bench, a single star was visible, though he could not have named it.

The sound came from the stairs — the particular heavy tread he would have known in a crowd of a hundred men. A pause at the landing. Then the door to the workshop floor opened, and Bardolino's bulk filled the frame, his nightshirt tucked into breeches he had pulled on in haste, his feet in leather slippers that whispered against the brick as he came forward.

He saw the open storeroom door first. Then the lens on the bench. Then Enzo.

"What have you done."

Not a question. The words came out flat and enormous in the quiet, the way a stone drops into a well — the sound first, then the waiting.

"Tell me what this is for, Maestro." Enzo kept his hands where they were, framing the lens. "The truth this time."

Bardolino's face did something complicated in the dim light. The muscles around his mouth drew tight, and his shoulders came up the way they did when a crucible cracked and the melt threatened to spill — that instinct to make the body a wall between the fire and whatever stood behind him.

"You will stand when I am speaking to you." His voice had dropped into the register Enzo recognized, the formal Venetian he used with customs officials and the provveditori when they came to inspect the furnace. Polite as a blade laid flat. "You will close that door, and you will replace what you have taken, and we will discuss your conduct in the morning when I have decided whether you still have a place in this house."

"Sit down," Enzo said.

The words surprised him as much as they did Bardolino. He had not planned them. But they were out now, loose in the air between the lens and the furnace mouth, and he watched them land. Bardolino's chin came up. His right hand moved to his side — not to strike, but lower, to the pocket of his breeches, where his fingers found the shape they were looking for. The millefiori piece. Enzo had seen him reach for it a thousand times: when the tax collector came, when Tomaso disappeared for three days in winter, when the price of soda ash doubled and the Murano agents shrugged and said the Turkish ships were late.

"You forget yourself, ragazzo."

"I have forgotten nothing." Enzo looked at the lens between his hands. The amber smear of refracted light had shifted as the coals settled, crawling a finger's width across the wood toward Bardolino's side of the bench. "I know about Fra Giordano's drawings. I know about the brass fittings Ser Moretto cast in November. I know about the device in the second crate, the one with the tube and the mounting bracket." He paused. The furnace ticked once, twice. "I know about Councillor Viaro."

The name did what he had expected it to do. Bardolino's hand stopped moving in his pocket. His whole body went still with the particular quality of stillness that hot glass has in the instant before it shatters — not peace, but the last moment of held shape, every internal stress balanced and screaming.

"Who told you that name."

"No one told me. I saw him at the Rialto. I saw who he was with."

Bardolino took a single step closer to the bench. The slippers made no sound. In the glow from the bocche, the old burns on his hands looked like a map of rivers seen from a great height — the silver scar tissue catching the light differently from the living skin around it. His face was in shadow above the line of his jaw, but Enzo could see the working of his throat, the effort of swallowing something back.

"You are a boy," Bardolino said. "You grind lenses. You do not understand what you are meddling in."

"Then help me understand."

Another silence. The furnace breathed. Somewhere outside, a dog barked once across the water and was answered by another, farther off, the sound carrying across the lagoon the way sound does at night when the air is cool and flat and there is nothing between one voice and the next.

Bardolino's hand came out of his pocket. The millefiori piece rested in his palm — that small disc of fused glass Enzo had watched him make years ago, the cross-sections of colored canes arranged in a flower pattern, blue and white and a deep red like the inside of a wound. He turned it between his thick fingers, the missing tip of the index finger making the gesture clumsy, exposing the smooth nub of healed skin where the shears had taken it twenty years before.

"Your father," Bardolino said, and stopped.

The furnace ticked. The lens sat between them, its curved surface holding the last of the light like a shallow bowl holds water. Enzo did not move. He did not speak. He understood that the next words were not his to say, that the space opening in the room was Bardolino's to fill or refuse, and that everything depended on which way the old man's pride broke — inward, toward confession, or outward, toward the door and whatever remained of the lie.

Bardolino looked at the millefiori piece in his hand. He looked at the lens. He looked at Enzo, and in the reddish glow from the dying coals, his eyes had the quality of glass at the precise moment it passes from liquid to solid — still bright, still almost fluid, but setting now, taking a shape that could not be undone.

He pulled the second stool from beneath the bench. The legs scraped against the brick floor, a sound like a match being struck. He sat down heavily, the way a man sits when he has been standing for a very long time and has only just realized it. His shoulders dropped. He set the millefiori piece on the workbench beside the lens — two pieces of glass, one small enough to hide in a fist, the other too large to conceal, both made in this furnace by hands that knew what they were doing.

"Your father asked me the same question," Bardolino said. His voice had lost the formal polish. What was underneath was rougher, older, hoarse in a way that had nothing to do with furnace smoke. "He sat where you are sitting. He had the same look." The thick fingers spread flat on the wood, scarred palms down, as if he were bracing himself against the bench or offering his hands for binding. "I did not answer him. I should have. What came after — what happened to Giacomo —" He shook his head once. "I will not make that error twice."

He drew a breath that Enzo heard enter him — a long, deliberate filling, the way the bellows fill before they feed the fire.

"Ask me again," Bardolino said.
