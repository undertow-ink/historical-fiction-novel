Bardolino sat. The stool creaked under him, and he placed both hands on the workbench, palms down, the way Enzo had seen him do a thousand times before shaping a difficult piece — grounding himself, reading the surface, deciding where to begin. The stolen lens lay between them. Neither touched it.

"Three years ago," Bardolino said. His voice had dropped to its lowest register, hoarse, almost conversational, the voice he used at the furnace when explaining something that mattered. "A man came to this workshop. Late. After the fires were banked. He did not give a name. He said he represented certain interests within the Republic — interests that required optical instruments of a precision that no other furnace on Murano could produce."

He paused. His thumb found the stump of his missing finger and pressed.

"I refused. I told him I was a glassmaker, not an armorer. He thanked me for my time and left. Polite. Well-dressed." Bardolino's eyes went to the furnace door, where the banked coals breathed their low orange line along the base. "Two weeks later, my account at the Banco di Rialto was frozen. An irregularity, they said. A clerical matter. It took eleven days to resolve, and in those eleven days I could not pay the wood suppliers, and without wood the furnace goes cold, and a cold furnace is a dead furnace, ragazzo. You know this."

Enzo knew.

"Viaro came back on the twelfth day. He brought the banking papers and an offer. Payment in gold for optical components built to specifications he would provide. Political protection — no guild inspections, no questions about the second furnace standing cold, no trouble from the creditors who were circling like gulls around a gutted fish. And all I had to do was grind glass."

Bardolino spread his hands on the bench. The scars caught the low light — burn marks, old cuts, the white seams of a life spent close to things that were hot and sharp.

"The furnace was dying, Enzo. Not failing — dying. I had twelve men whose families ate because I kept the fires burning. Old Beppe's daughter with the crippled foot. Marco Dolfin, who has no other trade and nowhere else to go. My son." He looked at Enzo. "You."

The word landed and lay between them like the lens.

"It would not be unreasonable," Bardolino said, and his voice took on the cadence of a man constructing an argument he had built and rebuilt in the dark of many nights, "for a man in my position to consider what the alternatives were. If I refused, the furnace closed. Twelve families starved. Three generations of fire — gone. And the Republic would have its lenses anyway. Do you understand? They would have them. Not from me, perhaps. From a lesser workshop, grinding inferior glass, producing instruments that would scatter when they should focus. The powerful do not abandon a weapon because one craftsman has qualms. They find another craftsman. They always find another."

He reached across and turned the stolen lens with one finger, rotating it slowly on the wood. The glass caught the furnace's glow and held it — a small trapped ember turning in the crystal.

"So I asked myself: if these lenses will exist regardless of what I choose, is it not better that they are ground by hands that know what they are doing? Better Murano cristallo than some Paduan rubbish that cracks in the sun. Better my furnace, where the profit feeds families I can name, than some stranger's furnace feeding families I cannot."

Enzo watched the lens turn. The argument was clean. Each piece fitted the next with the precision of a well-cut millefiori rod, and he could feel its logic working in him the way heat worked in glass — softening the shape, making it possible to bend what had been rigid. Bardolino was not wrong about the furnace. The debts, the families, the names — these were not abstractions. Enzo had eaten at this man's table. He had watched Bardolino count coins in the evening and divide them between what the furnace needed and what the workers deserved, and the second pile was always larger than the first.

"The craft is neutral." Bardolino's hand rested beside the lens. "The fire does not judge what it melts. A crucible does not ask what will be poured into its form. The glass is innocent, Enzo — transparent, that is its nature, that is what makes it glass and not stone. What a man does with the glass after it leaves this bench, that is his sin, not mine. The lens does not choose what it focuses. No more than your father's grinding wheel chose what curvature to cut."

At the mention of his father, Enzo's hands went still in his lap. The motion stopped so completely that the absence was louder than the furnace.

Bardolino saw it. His voice gentled.

"You think I do not understand what this costs. That because I agreed, I must have agreed easily." The hoarseness thickened. "I do not sleep. I have not slept a full night since Viaro's first visit. I stand at that furnace at three in the morning and I argue with myself the way a Talmudic scholar argues with God — back and forth, every angle, every rebuttal, and at the end of it the answer is the same, because the answer is not clean. There is no clean answer. You are young enough to believe in clean choices. I am old enough to know they do not exist."

The furnace settled behind them. A log shifted in the firebox, and the sound was soft, intimate, the sound of a house adjusting to its own heat.

"I took in your father's son. When Giacomo died and no other master on this island would touch you — a Jewish orphan, no family in the guild, no patron, nothing but a pair of hands and a name that frightened people because of how it ended — I gave you a bench. I taught you what I know. Not the trade only. The eye. How to see what the glass is doing before it knows itself." His voice had lost its argumentative structure. He was speaking as a man speaks when he is not sure the person across from him will be there tomorrow to hear it. "Was that nothing? Does one sin erase every kindness?"

He leaned forward over the bench.

"You sit in judgment of me, and you have the right — I gave you the right when I lied to you in this room, and I will not take it back. But when you judge, judge the whole man. Not the man who took Viaro's gold. The man who taught you to grind a concave surface blind, by touch, by the sound the paste makes when the curvature is true. The man who carried you to your mother the night the second furnace caught fire and you breathed smoke until your lips turned the color of ash. Judge that man too."

The argument sat in the air like a held note. Bardolino was not lying. This was not the smooth story he had told about the Paduan scholar, polished and false. This was rough, heavy, unfinished — the confession of a man who had convinced himself, or nearly, and needed Enzo to complete the convincing.

And the terrible thing, the thing Enzo could feel in his chest like a crack propagating through cooled glass, was that part of him wanted to be convinced. The part that loved this man, that owed this man his hands and his trade and the ability to look at a lens and see the mathematics of light inside it — that part wanted to set the question down and return to the grinding bench and let the argument close over the doubt the way molten glass closes over a bubble, trapping it, hiding it, making it invisible unless you held the finished piece to the light at precisely the right angle.

He sat with that for a long time. The furnace breathed. Bardolino waited. Between them the lens lay on the wood, and in the orange light it looked as though it were losing some final heat, some last memory of the fire that had made it.

"And my father?" Enzo asked.

His voice was quiet. The question was not the question it appeared to be. He was not asking how Giacomo had died. He was asking whether Bardolino would tell him the truth about it, here, now, after everything else he had said.

Bardolino's hand stopped.

It had been moving — the thumb against the stump, the old rhythm — and it stopped. His eyes left Enzo's face and traveled to the furnace door, to the thin line of orange at its base, and he looked at the fire the way a man looks at a fire when he does not want to look at the person across from him.

"Your father," Bardolino said at last, "was the finest grinder I ever knew. In fifty years of this trade, across every furnace on this island, I have not seen hands like his. Not yours, ragazzo, though yours are close. His." He was still looking at the furnace. "And he was a man who could not bend. Some glass bends under heat and takes a new shape and survives. And some glass — the purest, the clearest, the glass with no impurities to give it flexibility — shatters. Your father was that glass."

He said nothing else. His hand remained still on the workbench, the fingers spread, the scars white in the orange glow. His chest rose and fell once, deeply, the breath of a man setting down something heavy and finding it will not leave his arms.

Enzo watched the furnace light move across the maestro's face. The old skin, the deep lines, the pale eyes that would not turn back to him. Bardolino had not confessed. He had not denied. He had spoken of Giacomo with a reverence that was real and a grief that was visible in the stillness of his damaged hand, and what he had not said was louder than what he had — that he knew how the finest grinder on Murano had come to die, and that his silence afterward was its own kind of glass: clear enough to see through, strong enough to hold, and flawed in a place no one could reach.

Neither man moved. The workbench held them — the wood scarred and smoothed by decades of use, wide enough for two men to sit across from each other with a single lens between them and the truth incomplete between them and the furnace at their backs throwing its banked light across the room without preference or judgment, the way fire had always done.

The coals shifted. A thin line of sparks rose from the gap beneath the iron door, lived for a moment in the dark air, and went out. The heat in the workshop had begun its long nightly retreat, pulling back from the walls, from the benches, from the skin of the two men who sat in it, but it did not disappear. It never disappeared entirely. It held in the bricks and in the iron and in the mortar between, patient and indifferent, waiting for morning, when someone would open the door and feed it and it would rise again without memory of what it had warmed or whom it had failed to save.
