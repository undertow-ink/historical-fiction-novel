The water stank of sulfur and celebration. Bardolino gripped the gunwale of the traghetto as it swung wide of a barge hung with torches, the flames throwing copper light across the faces of six men singing something about French whores and Venetian steel, and the boatman cursed and dug his oar deep and the hull scraped past with inches to spare. Smoke rose from a dozen points across the city, bonfire smoke, and beneath it the older smell of the lagoon at low tide, the mud and salt and rot that was Venice's true perfume, the one no amount of incense or rosewater could bury.

He should not have come.

The thought arrived the way such thoughts always did — too late, dressed in the clothes of reason, carrying nothing useful. He had told himself the crossing was practical. The celebration would draw the customs men from the quays, and he needed to see about a shipment of antimony that had been sitting in a Dorsoduro warehouse for eleven days. He had told himself this while putting on his better doublet, the dark wool one that did not show the burn marks. He had told himself this while locking the workshop door and checking it twice. The antimony was real. The excuse was not, or not entirely, and the difference between the two was a country he had learned to inhabit with a kind of grim fluency.

The traghetto bumped against the molo and he climbed out heavily, his knees protesting the step up to the stone, his weight shifting in the way that announced itself to him now every morning — the thickening at his waist, the heaviness of a body that spent its days bent over crucibles and grinding wheels rather than walking or riding or doing any of the things that kept other men from becoming what he was becoming. Fifty-six years old. His father had died at forty-eight, face-down in a sand mold, and his grandfather at sixty with lungs like wet parchment. He was somewhere between, a man in the soft middle of a hard trade.

The piazza opened before him like a throat.

Torches lined the arcade of the Procuratie, and between the columns of the Doge's Palace someone had strung banners — the Lion of Saint Mark repeated in gold on blue, the paint still wet enough to gleam. The crowd was enormous, larger than he had seen since the Sensa, bodies packed so tightly that movement became a kind of negotiation, shoulder against shoulder, elbow finding rib, the whole mass swaying with its own tidal logic. Above everything the bells of the campanile rang in a sustained, joyous clamor that turned the air itself into a vibrating skin.

Victory. The Republic had won a great victory at Fornovo.

Bardolino had read the dispatches reprinted on broadsheets nailed to the columns of the Rialto. He had listened to the men at the taverna on Murano parse the numbers — a thousand French dead, two thousand of the League, the battle fought in rain on ground turned to soup, cavalry charges dissolving into butchery in knee-deep mud. The Marquis of Mantua had led the charge. The Stradiots had cut the French baggage train to pieces. And Charles had walked away. That was the part the broadsheets did not emphasize. The French king and his army had crossed Italy, fought the combined forces of Venice, Milan, the Papal States, and the Empire, and walked away. The Republic called it victory because it had captured the baggage. Charles called it victory because he was alive and marching north. The word meant what the speaker needed it to mean.

He had learned something about that kind of language.

Near the basilica's central portal, where the gold mosaics caught the torchlight and threw it back in broken pieces, a platform had been raised. On it, arranged with the care of a jeweler setting stones, lay the captured French war booty. Bardolino let the crowd carry him close enough to see. A tent of blue silk embroidered with fleurs-de-lis, folded but displayed so the pattern showed. Silver plate — a dozen pieces, cups and ewers and a basin chased with hunting scenes. A sword with a pommel shaped like a lion's head, which someone had polished until it caught every flame in the piazza. A helmet with a broken visor. A book of hours, opened to a page where the Virgin held the Christ child against a field of lapis blue so pure it made his craftsman's eye ache with recognition — ground Afghan lazurite, worth more per ounce than the silver plate beside it. And in a crystal reliquary, set apart on a cloth of gold, a sliver of dark wood no longer than a finger.

A piece of the True Cross. Taken from a French king's personal chapel.

The crowd pressed forward to see it, crossing themselves, and Bardolino crossed himself too, the gesture automatic. His left hand was already in his pocket, the shortened finger — the one the shears had taken twenty years ago — pressing against the millefiori piece that sat warm against his thigh, its smooth glass surface a comfort he would not have admitted to anyone, least of all himself.

"The lapis is Badakhshan province, if I am not mistaken."

The voice came from his left, close enough to suggest the speaker had been standing there for some time, waiting for exactly this moment. Bardolino did not turn immediately. He let a breath pass. Then another. His body understood what his mind was still catching up to — the particular quality of dread that Viaro's voice produced, not sharp but low, like the hum of a cracked furnace wall that might hold another season or might not.

"Signore Viaro."

"Maestro Bardolino." Viaro stood with his hands clasped lightly before him, the gold ring catching a torch's flicker, his dark silk doublet absorbing light rather than reflecting it. The scar along his jawline was a thin white line tonight, nearly invisible. He looked as if he had been placed here by arrangement with the piazza itself, as natural as a column. "A fine evening for celebration. The Republic has much to be grateful for."

"So I understand."

"You do not sound convinced."

"I am a glassmaker. I leave military assessments to military men."

Viaro smiled — not the word for it, but the motion of his mouth that served the function of a smile the way a painted fire serves the function of warmth. "Wise. And yet the military men are themselves divided. The Marquis of Mantua claims a great triumph. The Stradiots are heroes of the hour — did you see them earlier? Riding through the piazza with French pennants on their lances?" He paused. "The veterans who fought at the river tell a different story. The French artillery, apparently, was something beyond expectation. The sound alone. Horses screaming. Men turned to — well." Another pause, calibrated. "But you did not come to hear war stories."

"I came to see about a shipment of antimony."

"Of course you did." Viaro's tone carried no irony, which was how Bardolino knew it was entirely ironic. "I wanted to say — the latest work has been exceptional. The lenses you delivered in June. The clarity, the precision of the curvature. I showed the specifications to a man who understands such things, and he used the word 'remarkable.' I do not use it lightly, and neither did he."

The praise landed like a stone in his stomach. Bardolino's hand tightened around the millefiori piece. "They are optical components. The craft is the same whether the lens goes into a reading glass or a surveyor's instrument."

"Precisely so. The craft is neutral. Your own words, if I recall."

His own words. Thrown back to him across three years like a ball returned over a wall, arriving with its original spin reversed.

"The project has drawn attention," Viaro said. He said it the way a man might note that the weather had changed — an observation, requiring no particular response. "At the highest levels. There are members of the Collegio who have taken a personal interest. I have been asked to convey that the Council is aware of the work, and appreciative."

Bardolino felt the crowd moving around him the way water moves around a pier — continuous, indifferent, pressing on all sides. The bells were still ringing. Someone nearby was laughing, a woman's laugh, bright and careless and belonging to a world where words meant only what they said.

"The project is theoretical," Bardolino said. "The lenses are components. What someone might do with them in the future — that is speculation. The focusing ratios at the distances described would require —"

"Maestro." Viaro raised one hand, a gentle gesture, the way a priest might silence a confession that had gone on too long. "I have no understanding of focusing ratios. I am merely a servant of the Republic, passing along the Republic's gratitude. And its expectations." He let the word sit. "It would be unfortunate if the Council's enthusiasm were not matched by the workshop's commitment."

There it was.

The sentence hung between them with the precision of a glass rod balanced on its center point — a construction so perfectly symmetrical that it could tip in either direction, compliment or threat, encouragement or promise of destruction, and the beauty of it, the craftsmanship of it, was that it was both at once, and Viaro knew that Bardolino knew, and the knowing was itself part of the design.

"I have never failed to deliver what was commissioned," Bardolino said.

"No," Viaro agreed. "You have not." He unclasped his hands, adjusted the cuff of his doublet, a gesture of such unhurried elegance that it contained its own dismissal. "Enjoy the celebration, Maestro. The Republic has earned its festivities. And so, in its way, has your workshop."

He turned and was absorbed by the crowd with the ease of a fish entering dark water — a movement, a shadow, and then nothing, as if he had never been there at all, as if the conversation had been something Bardolino had conducted with himself, which in a sense it always was, Viaro being less a man than a function, a mechanism through which the Republic's will expressed itself the way heat expressed itself through a crucible wall — invisibly, inevitably, until the contents transformed or the vessel cracked.

Bardolino stood in the piazza. The bells rang. The bonfires threw their light against the basilica's gold domes, and the mosaics gleamed like the surface of a molten pour, and the crowd celebrated a victory that was not a victory for a Republic that used the word the way it used all words — as a tool, shaped to purpose, indifferent to the material's original nature.

He took the millefiori piece from his pocket and held it in his scarred palm. The glass was warm. The tiny flowers embedded in its core — red, white, blue, gold — were as precise and permanent as the day they were made, fused at temperatures that would have consumed the flowers they imitated. That was the secret the craft taught you, if you were willing to learn it. That beauty required destruction. That the form survived only because the original had burned.

The antimony could wait. Everything could wait except the thing that would not.

He put the glass back in his pocket and walked toward the molo, away from the torches and the banners and the singing, a heavy man moving through a celebrating city, his shadow thrown long across the stones by fires he had not lit but that burned, he understood now, partly with fuel he had provided.
