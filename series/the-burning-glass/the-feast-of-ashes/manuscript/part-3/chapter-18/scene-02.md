The oar-splash behind him was already fading, the gondolier turning back toward the Fondamenta Nuove, and Bardolino sat alone in the sandolo with his hands on his knees and the lagoon opening ahead like a black field. Venice receded. The lanterns along the Riva, the bonfires on the Piazzetta where they were still singing — all of it contracting to a smear of orange against the southern sky. He could hear drums, or thought he could. Sound traveled strangely over water at night.

He had hired the boat at the traghetto near Santa Maria dei Miracoli, paying double because the boatman wanted to stay for the celebration and had to be persuaded that a fat glassmaker's need to cross to Murano outweighed the promise of free wine and a spectacle. The boatman was young. He did not understand that some men wanted only to leave.

The water was flat, almost oily in the last of the twilight, and the air carried the particular smell of the lagoon in July — salt and weed and the faint mineral undertone of mud baking all day in the shallows and now releasing its stored heat into the evening. Bardolino breathed it. The smell of his commute, his twice-daily passage between the world where decisions were made and the world where they were carried out. Forty years of this crossing. He had made it so many times that his body knew the duration without counting — the slight shift of current where the channel narrowed past San Michele, the moment when Murano's silhouette resolved from the general darkness of the northern lagoon into distinct shapes. Chimneys. Bell towers. The long low roofline of the furnaces along the Fondamenta dei Vetrai.

Tonight the chimneys stood against a sky that was not yet dark but no longer light, that bruised violet that July evenings held for an hour after sunset, and their columns of residual smoke — thin at this hour, most furnaces banked — rose and dissolved without wind to trouble them.

He put his hand in his pocket. The millefiori piece was there, smooth against his thumb, and he turned it without thinking, the way a man works a stone in a stream. He had made the piece at nineteen — his first successful millefiori pull, the cane slicing cleanly under the wheel, the cross-section revealing its concentric rings of cobalt and gold and milk-white in perfect alignment. Thirty-seven years he had carried it. Thirty-seven years of reaching into his pocket and finding it there like a small, fused proof that his hands could make something that lasted.

Viaro's voice was still in his ear. *The interest of certain parties in the Collegio.* Viaro had said it the way a man mentions the weather — lightly, as if the information were incidental, as if it did not alter the ground beneath Bardolino's feet. But Viaro was a man who used lightness the way a glassblower uses the punty iron: to control, to turn, to shape something hot into the form he required.

The Collegio. Not a single agent of the Council of Ten running a private scheme for advantage. The state. The Republic itself, with its committees and its secretaries and its bottomless memory, had turned its attention to the furnace on the Fondamenta dei Vetrai where Vittorio Bardolino made glass and, in a locked storeroom behind the annealing oven, ground lenses for a device he had spent two years telling himself would never function.

The sandolo scraped against the mooring post. He climbed out — heavy, his knees protesting the shift from sitting to standing, the way they always did now, the cartilage worn thin from decades of standing at the furnace mouth on stone floors. He tied the boat with a clumsy knot. His hands were thick. The missing tip of his left index finger, where the shears had taken it twenty years ago, ached in the cooling air. His hands always told the weather before his mind could.

The fondamenta was quiet. A dog barked somewhere behind the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli. He walked the familiar route — past Barovier's furnace, dark and shuttered, past the little shrine to the Madonna where someone had left fresh flowers, past the wellhead where women gathered in the mornings — and the sound of his own footsteps on the stone was the only sound, steady and heavy, the footfall of a man who weighed more than he should and knew it.

He unlocked the furnace door.

Inside, the heat met him like a hand laid against his face. The forno had been banked — Tomaso's work, or perhaps old Zanetti, who had been banking furnaces since before Bardolino was born and who could read the fire's mood the way a physician reads a pulse. The main chamber glowed faintly through the bocche, that deep orange that meant the fire had been fed its last meal of the day and was settling into its long night's digestion, consuming itself slowly, holding enough heat in the brick to make the morning's rekindling possible. A furnace was never truly out. To let it go cold was to kill it — the thermal shock would crack the walls, split the crucible, undo in a single night the patient accumulation of temperature that took days to rebuild.

He stood in the doorway and let his eyes adjust. The main workspace opened around him. The marver, its flat stone surface still warm to the touch if he were to lay his palm on it. The tool racks along the near wall, each blowpipe and pontil hanging in its place, cleaned and ordered, the discipline of the workshop visible in every rack and shelf. Tomaso was good at this. Tomaso had the temperament for order, if not yet the hands for greatness.

Along the far wall, the grinding benches. Three of them, spaced for the light that came through the high windows during the day. The nearest was Enzo's. He walked to it.

The bench was clean. The grinding wheels — two of them, one coarse, one fine — sat in their cradles, and the polishing tools hung from their pegs in the rack above, each handle marked with the chalk symbols Enzo had devised to identify grit and grade. The boy had organized this himself, had brought a system to what had been, under his father's tenure, a more intuitive arrangement. Giacomo had known each tool by touch, by habit, by the memory in his hands. Enzo was learning to know them by system, by method, by a precision that was his own and not his father's, and Bardolino did not know whether this was progress or loss.

The bench where Giacomo's son ground the same lenses Giacomo once ground. The bench where a boy who now knew what the lenses were for — who had stood in this workshop three months ago and placed the stolen cristallo between them and demanded the truth — still came each morning, still sat, still worked. That was the thing Bardolino could not account for. He had expected Enzo to leave. Had prepared himself for it in the days after the confrontation, had rehearsed the explanations he would give Tomaso and the other workers. But Enzo had come back to the bench the next morning, and the morning after, and every morning since, and he ground the lenses with the same care he had always shown, and he said nothing about what he knew, and the silence between them had changed from the silence of ignorance to the silence of a shared secret, which was heavier, and closer, and more dangerous than any lie.

He left the grinding bench and walked back to the forno.

The glory hole was sealed with its iron door, but the nearest bocca was open — Tomaso sometimes left one open when banking, to let the furnace breathe, as the old practice prescribed — and through that small arch of darkness, the fire's interior was visible. Not flame. Flame was daytime, was work, was the roaring appetite of a furnace in full operation. This was the night face: embers banked under ash, the crucible glowing at its base, the slow pulse of heat that rose and fell with drafts too subtle to feel. The brickwork around the opening radiated warmth into his face, his throat, his chest. He stood close. Closer than was comfortable.

Forty years he had fed this fire. He had rebuilt the walls his father's neglect had cracked. He had paid the debts that would have seen the furnace sold to Barovier or Seguso or one of the other families who circled like crows when a furnace faltered. He had married, fathered children, buried his wife, trained apprentices, broken his body in the service of this single, consuming thing — this hole in the earth filled with fire that ate sand and soda ash and transformed them into something that caught light and held it. His life's work. The thing he had saved and the thing that had consumed the saving.

And now the Republic had reached into his furnace the way a glassmaker reaches into the bocca with his pipe, and what it drew out would not be glass.

The fire ticked. Brick contracted against iron, iron against mortar, each material cooling at its own rate, each one pulling away from its neighbor with a sound like a dry knuckle cracking. He knew the sound the way he knew his own pulse. He had fallen asleep to it ten thousand nights. The voice of the furnace, speaking its slow, mineral language, telling him what he already understood — that a fire fed long enough becomes the thing that feeds on you, that the mouth you open each morning to pour in fuel has its own hunger, and that hunger has no end, and no loyalty, and no memory of what it cost you to keep it alive.

He stood at the bocca until the heat dried his eyes and he had to step back.

The millefiori piece was still in his hand. He did not remember taking it from his pocket. He looked at it — the rings of color, blue and gold and white, fused together by a fire he had lit at nineteen, inseparable now, each layer locked to the others by the heat that made them. He closed his fist around it and put it away.

Behind him, through the open furnace door, the fondamenta and the lagoon beyond it, and beyond that, invisible in the darkness, Venice, where men in rooms he would never enter had spoken his name and the name of his furnace and decided what both would be used for. The drums had stopped, or the distance had swallowed them. He could not tell.
