The crate of grinding paste was heavier than it should have been, and Enzo shifted it against his hip as he turned from the apothecary's counter into the noon glare of the Ruga degli Orefici. Heat sat on Venice like a hand pressed over a mouth. The canal water had thickened to a green-black soup that smelled of rot and salt, and the flies were impossible — they found the sweat at his temples, the paste residue on his knuckles, the damp circle where the crate pressed his tunic against his ribs. He walked with the yellow badge facing outward, as he always did, because tucking it inward invited worse than the stares.

He was calculating. Three pounds of emery paste, the fine grade. A half-pound of cerium compound that Silvio had requested and that had cost more than Enzo carried, so that the apothecary had extended credit against the workshop's name, writing it into a ledger with a quill that needed cutting. Enzo had watched the man's hand and thought about tolerances — how a poor edge on a quill nib spread the ink a quarter-millimeter wider, how that imprecision compounded across a page, a ledger, a year of accounts. How the things people failed to notice accumulated into the things that ruined them.

"You carry that like a man who knows what's inside it."

The voice came from his left, from the shadowed loggia where the goldsmiths kept their scales. Enzo turned. The man stood against a column with the ease of someone who had been there for some time, or who wanted to give that impression. Dark silk doublet, cut close. A gold ring on the right hand, heavy enough to catch the light that filtered through the arcade. The scar along his jawline — a thin line, old, precise as a scribe's rule.

Enzo knew him. Had catalogued him months ago at the Rialto, the man he'd named the Silk in his private taxonomy of faces. The man who visited Bardolino's furnace in the dead hours. The man whose trust Bardolino feared more than his anger.

"Cerium oxide and emery paste," Enzo said. "Not very interesting."

"To most people." The man stepped out of the shadow. He moved the way good glass moved through an annealing oven — smooth, controlled, every degree of heat accounted for. "To a lens grinder, those compounds are the difference between a surface that refracts cleanly and one that scatters. You'd know that. You're Giacomo Sforno's son."

The name hit like a stone dropped into still water. Enzo felt the ripple in his chest, kept it from his face. He had practiced that. In the two years since his father's death, since the furnace, since all of it, he had learned to hold his features the way he held a blank — steady, giving nothing to the wheel that wasn't intended.

"I am."

"You have your father's eyes and your father's skill." The man came closer. Three steps. He stopped at a distance that was neither intimate nor formal — the distance of a business negotiation, of a proposal. He smelled faintly of something warm and animal. Ambergris. "Venice has need of both."

Enzo set the crate down on the flagstones. His arms were tired and he wanted his hands free, though he could not have said for what. "I don't know you, signore."

"No," the man agreed. "But you've been looking for me."

The street noise continued around them — a porter arguing about mooring fees, a woman selling figs from a basket, the eternal slap of water against stone. None of it reached whatever space the man had constructed between them. His eyes were dark brown, steady, and he did not blink as often as people should.

"My name is Viaro. I serve the Republic in a capacity that doesn't require elaboration." He paused. "You've been conducting an investigation. I use the word generously — you've been picking locks, reading documents you lack the authority to read, and confronting men with stolen property. Bardolino was quite distressed. He's not a man built for confrontation."

The air went out of Enzo's lungs in a way he controlled, breathing slowly through his nose, keeping the exhale even. Viaro knew. Of course Viaro knew. A man like this — and Enzo understood now what kind of man this was, understood it the way he understood a flaw deep in a lens blank, visible only when you held it at the precise angle to the light — a man like this made it his work to know.

"I don't know what you mean," Enzo said.

Viaro's expression didn't change. It didn't need to. "Enzo. May I call you Enzo? I'm not here to threaten you. If I wanted you silenced, we would not be having a conversation in daylight near the Rialto. I would not be telling you my name." He adjusted the gold ring on his finger, a small habitual motion. "I'm here because you impressed me. You picked Bardolino's lock — a Nuremberg mechanism, not simple. You identified the lens configuration from workshop notes that most trained opticians would find opaque. You understood what you were looking at."

Each fact laid down like a card on a table. Enzo watched Viaro's hands. The fingers were clean, the nails trimmed close. No calluses from labor. Calluses, though, at the base of the index and middle fingers of the right hand — from a pen. A man who wrote constantly. Reports, perhaps. Assessments.

"What I was looking at," Enzo repeated, giving the words no inflection.

"You see my difficulty." Viaro tilted his head. "You've already demonstrated that you understand the project. The question is what the Republic does with a young man who possesses that understanding without authorization. There are several possibilities. Most of them, I think you can imagine."

A barge passed in the canal behind them, and its wake slapped the fondamenta. The sound was ordinary. Everything around them was ordinary. Two men talking in a loggia on a hot August afternoon. Nothing worth noticing.

"But I prefer the possibility that interests me most," Viaro continued. "The Council requires someone with genuine optical expertise to evaluate the project's progress. Someone who understands lens geometry, focal convergence, the behavior of light at compounded surfaces. Bardolino is a glassblower. Brilliant with his hands, limited in his theory. Your father was the theorist. Your father is dead." He said this without cruelty, without sympathy — the way one might note that a bridge had collapsed, stating the engineering problem that resulted. "The project needs what your father provided. You can provide it."

"I'm an apprentice," Enzo said. "I grind lenses for spectacles and reading stones."

"You are an apprentice who reconstructed a state secret from workshop notes and a single stolen lens. Don't insult us both."

Enzo looked at the yellow circle on his chest. He did not gesture toward it, did not need to. Viaro followed his gaze.

"Yes," Viaro said. "What little a Jewish apprentice can claim in the way of patriotic duty, I understand. The Republic asks much and offers your people less than it should. I won't pretend otherwise." He met Enzo's eyes again. "But the Republic is also the only power in the peninsula that lets your people live on its islands, practice your trades, grind your lenses. Charles of France would not have been so generous. Nor will the next army that comes, unless Venice can defend its waters."

This was the trap. Enzo could see it — the geometry of it, clean as a lens diagram. If he refused on grounds of incapacity, Viaro had already demonstrated that he knew Enzo was capable. If he refused on grounds of ignorance — claimed he didn't understand the project — then the conversation they were having made no sense, and Viaro would know he was lying. If he refused on grounds of loyalty or conscience, he was admitting he knew what the weapon was and what it did, which meant he was a security risk rather than an asset, and security risks were managed differently than assets.

The only door Viaro had left open was the one Viaro wanted him to walk through.

"What would it involve?" Enzo heard himself ask. The words came out steady.

"Periodic evaluations. You'd visit the workshop — openly, under my authority, not through picked locks in the small hours. You'd assess the optical progress and report to me. Directly to me, no intermediaries." Viaro produced a small folded paper from inside his doublet. He did not hand it to Enzo. He set it on top of the crate of grinding paste, as if it were nothing — a receipt, a scrap. "A time and place for our first proper meeting. Destroy it once you've committed the details to memory. I trust your memory is adequate."

"And if I prefer not to involve myself."

Viaro looked at him. The dark eyes held nothing — no malice, no warmth. They were surfaces without depth, like obsidian, like glass that had been ground past transparency into something opaque and final.

"Then I would understand," Viaro said. "And I would be sorry. Because the alternative means that a talented young man who has already involved himself — without authorization, without protection, without allies — continues to operate alone. And alone, in my experience, is where talented young men make mistakes that cannot be corrected." He smoothed the front of his doublet. "It would be unfortunate. Particularly given what happened to your father, who was also talented, and also alone."

The flies circled. The heat pressed down. Somewhere past the loggia, a glass vendor was hawking cheap beads to German traders, his voice rising and falling in a singsong patter that carried across the water.

Enzo picked up the crate. The folded paper sat on top of it, small and white and weightless.

He did not brush it off.

Viaro watched him, and something moved behind those flat dark eyes — satisfaction, perhaps, or the beginning of it. The expression of a man who had built a mechanism and watched it engage, gear finding gear, each tooth precise.

"Your father would have understood," Viaro said. "He served the Republic too. In his way."

He stepped back into the shadow of the loggia. The gold ring caught the light once and then didn't. By the time Enzo turned fully, Viaro was moving through the crowd near the Fondaco with the unhurried ease of a man who had nowhere to be and everywhere to go, his dark silk blending into the press of bodies until he was indistinguishable from any other gentleman of Venice, which was, Enzo understood, the entire point.

He walked back toward the traghetto landing with the crate against his hip and the paper balanced on its lid. The yellow circle on his chest caught the sun. A woman selling eels glanced at it, then away. A porter stepped slightly wider around him. The ordinary negotiations of his ordinary life, conducted in the ordinary currency of a difference he had not chosen and could not put down.

The paper stayed where it was.

By the time he reached the boat, he had already memorized the address.
