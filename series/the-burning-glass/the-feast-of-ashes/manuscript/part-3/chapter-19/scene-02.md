The wine was already poured.

Two cups of Malvasia on a table pushed against the back wall, where the afternoon light from the canal-side window did not reach. Enzo stood in the doorway of the narrow shop and catalogued what he saw: the cups, the empty room, the shopkeeper wiping the same glass he'd been wiping when Enzo passed the window, and Viaro seated with his back to the corner, one hand resting on the table beside a leather folio tied with cord. The scar along his jaw caught the edge of the light. His silk doublet was the color of an overripe plum, near black.

"Sit," Viaro said. Not a command. An assumption.

Enzo sat. The chair had been placed so that he faced the wall, his back to the door and the shopkeeper both. He understood the geometry of it — Viaro could see everything; Enzo could see only Viaro. A lens arrangement, of a kind. One element controlled the field of view.

"You look tired," Viaro said.

"I sleep well enough."

"A man who sleeps well has no reason to come when summoned."

The note had arrived that morning, folded into a scrap of paper tucked beneath the workshop door before the first bell. No signature. Only an address and a time. Enzo had spent an hour deciding not to come, and then he had come.

Viaro untied the cord on the leather folio. His fingers were unhurried, precise, the nails clean and filed to smooth curves — a patrician's hands, or a surgeon's. The gold ring on his right hand caught the candlelight. Inside the folio lay three sheets of heavy paper, and on the paper, drawings.

Enzo recognized them instantly. Not the hand — he had never seen Fra Giordano's draftsmanship before — but the logic. Compound lens arrays, six elements in sequence, each drawn in cross-section with the radii of curvature marked in tiny numerals. Alongside the arrays: a mirror system, parabolic, with angle measurements that accounted for solar declination across seasons. The hand that drew these understood refraction the way a musician understood intervals — not as theory but as felt proportion.

"I am told you can read these," Viaro said.

Enzo kept his hands flat on the table. "Anyone who grinds lenses can read a cross-section."

"Anyone who grinds lenses can read the shape. Very few can assess whether the geometry will produce the specified result." Viaro turned the second sheet so that it faced Enzo directly. "Fra Giordano's latest compound design. Six elements. He believes this arrangement will achieve focal concentration at eleven braccia. The Collegio wishes to know if he is correct."

The Collegio. Spoken as simply as one might say the weather.

Enzo did not touch the paper. He looked at it from across the table, and his mind — his traitor mind, his grinding-wheel mind that could not stop turning — began to read. The first four elements were sound. Better than sound. The biconvex pair at the front gathered light with an elegance that made his hands itch to cut the blanks. The achromatic correction in the third element was years ahead of anything he had seen in any workshop in Venice or Padua or anywhere else.

But the fifth element was wrong.

The radius of curvature was too shallow. At that thickness, with that glass — and Fra Giordano had specified Murano soda-lime, he could see the density notation — the refraction through the fifth element would scatter the focal point across a handspan rather than concentrating it. The sixth element could not compensate. The focal distance would stretch to fifteen braccia at minimum, possibly seventeen, and the intensity at the point of convergence would dissipate to uselessness.

He saw it the way he saw flaws in a blank: whole and immediate, a wrongness that preceded language.

"The focal distance is off," Enzo said.

The words were out before his teeth could catch them. A reflex. The same reflex that made him correct apprentices mid-grind, that made him reach across a bench to adjust an angle before the error could propagate through the curve. His hands had even lifted from the table, as if to point.

Viaro's expression did not change. But something settled behind his eyes — a stillness, the way a cat goes still not before it pounces but after the mouse has stepped into the open.

"By how much?" Viaro asked.

Enzo closed his mouth. He looked at his own hands, suspended above the table, and set them back down. The calluses on his right thumb and forefinger were thick and yellow, the permanent marks of the grinding wheel. His father's hands had carried the same marks. Everyone in the trade bore them, but on Giacomo's hands they had been deeper, older, mapped across the palm like the contour lines on Fra Giordano's drawings.

"I did not come here to do this," Enzo said.

"You came here because you cannot stop yourself from doing precisely this." Viaro folded his hands together. "And that is exactly why we need you."

We. Not I. A word that erected walls on every side.

"The fifth element," Enzo said, because the silence required filling and because the answer was already assembled and because refusing to speak it now would not unspeak what he had already said. "The radius is too shallow for soda-lime at that thickness. You need either a deeper curve or crown glass, and if you go to crown, the density change propagates through the sixth element and you have to regrind the whole rear group. The focal distance as drawn will land somewhere past fifteen braccia. Perhaps seventeen."

He stopped. Viaro was watching him the way a man watches a fire when it catches — not with surprise but with the calm attention of someone who laid the kindling hours ago.

"Fra Giordano suspected as much," Viaro said. "He has not had access to a master grinder in some months. Theory outruns practice without the hand to test it." He paused, and the pause was a door being opened. "Your father understood these principles. The relationship between curvature and density, the corrections that only a man who has felt the glass under the wheel can make." Another pause, shorter, sharper, a blade being turned. "It is fitting that his son continues the work."

Enzo's hands went still on the table.

Giacomo. Spoken with the exact weight of respect that made the word a stone placed on a scale. Not a threat. Nothing so crude. Viaro did not threaten. He arranged facts in sequences that carried their own gravity, and then he let the facts do their work, the way a lensmaker arranged elements in a barrel and let the light do its own bending.

"I have agreed to nothing," Enzo said.

"Of course not." Viaro gathered the drawings back into the folio and retied the cord with the same unhurried precision. "You have merely confirmed what we already suspected — that the design requires correction, and that you are capable of identifying the nature of the correction. These are observations, not commitments. No man is bound by his own competence."

But every man is trapped by it. Viaro did not say this. He did not need to.

"The wine is from my cousin's estate in Friuli," Viaro said. "It would be a shame to waste it."

Enzo drank. The Malvasia was dry, cold, very good. It tasted like being swallowed.

He left the shop ten minutes later, into the close heat of the Venetian afternoon, where the light off the canal struck the buildings opposite with a glare that made him squint. September light. Angled lower now, the sun already beginning its autumn descent toward the lagoon. He walked without direction, his feet finding the familiar geometries of the calli, and with each step the architecture of what had just happened assembled itself in his mind with the same clarity he brought to reading an optical diagram.

He had identified the flaw. In doing so, he had demonstrated expertise that went beyond casual knowledge — the kind of expertise that made him useful, the kind that made him dangerous to leave uncontrolled. He had spoken the correction aloud, which meant Viaro now possessed it, which meant the project would advance because of Enzo's words, which meant Enzo was no longer an observer. He had handled nothing, signed nothing, accepted nothing.

And none of that mattered.

The trap was not a single mechanism. It was compound, like the lenses — each element bending the path a few degrees more, each refusal made costlier by the refusal before it. If he went to the Council of Ten now, he would have to explain how he knew enough to identify the flaw. If he stayed silent, he was complicit in a project that had already drawn the Collegio's eye. If he refused the next meeting, Viaro would simply wait, because Viaro understood what Enzo understood: that a man who sees a flaw in a design cannot unfeel the itch to correct it.

Giacomo had seen the same designs. Giacomo had known the same principles. Giacomo was dead.

Enzo reached the Rialto bridge and stopped. Below him the Grand Canal moved in its slow, filthy, shining way, carrying barges and reflected light and the city's commerce toward the sea. He pressed his hands against the stone railing and felt the warmth of the sun-heated surface against his grinding calluses.

He had agreed to nothing. He had consented to everything. The distinction, which had seemed important an hour ago, had resolved itself into transparency — present, measurable, and as thin as glass.
