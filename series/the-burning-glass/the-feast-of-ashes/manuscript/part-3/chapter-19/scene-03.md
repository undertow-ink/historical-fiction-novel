The furnace smoke drifted east across the fondamenta, and Enzo walked into it the way he had walked into everything since Tuesday — without deciding to, without stopping.

Serena was already there. She stood where the fondamenta curved along the rio dei Vetrai, one hand resting on the stone ledge that ran above the canal wall, and she watched him come toward her with the same expression she wore when a column of figures refused to reconcile. Patient. Specific. Already calculating what was wrong.

He had sent word through Tomaso. Just the place and the hour. She had come without asking why, and that was worse than questions, because it meant she already knew something was off. She had always been better at reading what he left out than what he put in.

"You're late," she said.

"I'm not."

"You walk faster when you're not thinking about where you're going. Tonight you're slow." She pushed off the ledge and fell into step beside him. "So you're thinking."

The fondamenta stretched ahead of them — the same path, the same hour, the same chimneys venting their pale streams against a sky the color of ash and copper. A year ago they had walked this route discussing coefficients of expansion, and Enzo had kept half a pace between them, a distance so precise it might have been ground on a lathe. He had matched her stride without letting his sleeve touch hers. He had listened to her talk about the way different glasses tore themselves apart in cooling and had understood that she was talking about more than glass.

Tonight he could not maintain the distance. Not because he chose to close it but because his body had forgotten the calibration. His arm brushed hers as they passed the first furnace. She did not pull away. He did not correct.

"Something happened," she said. Not a question.

"Yes."

"At the glassworks?"

"Near it."

She waited. The canal water moved below them, green-black in the fading light, carrying the day's glass dust in a film that caught the last of the sun like a skin of gold leaf. Two boys ran past them toward the traghetto, barefoot, shouting about a cat. Serena waited until the shouting faded.

"Tell me what you can," she said. "Leave out what you have to."

Enzo had rehearsed this. Walking from the ghetto to the traghetto, standing on the boat with his hands in his sleeves, walking from the Murano landing to this stretch of stone — he had tried every arrangement of words that would say enough without saying too much. None of them worked. Language, he had learned from Viaro, was just another material that could be shaped into a tool or a trap, and he no longer trusted his ability to tell the difference.

"There are people," he said, "who want me to do something."

He stopped walking. She stopped with him. The fondamenta was empty in both directions, the workers already gone to their suppers, the furnace doors banked for the night. Only the farthest glassworks still threw light — a low orange glow that reached them in a wash, turning the stone the color of fired clay.

"If I do it, I become part of what they're doing. If I refuse —" He looked at the canal. "If I refuse, I become a problem. And they don't leave problems."

Serena did not ask who. She did not ask what they wanted. She stood beside him with her hands at her sides and her face turned toward his, and he could see her doing what she did with account books, with manifests, with any document that had been altered — she was reading the gaps. The names he had not spoken. The shape of the thing he carried, visible only by what it displaced.

"How long?" she said.

"Since last month."

"And you can't leave it."

"No."

"And you can't do what they want."

He said nothing. That was the answer she needed, and she took it the way she took all information: without flinching, without looking away, with the quick precise inventory of someone who needed to know exactly how bad the numbers were before she could begin to work.

The wind came off the lagoon and pressed her braid against her neck. A strand of dark auburn had come loose — it always came loose — and lay against her cheek like a line drawn by a careless hand. The glass beads at her throat shifted with her breathing: seventeen of them, one for each year, each one made by her father's hands, each a different color that he had chosen in the year of its making.

"You're afraid," she said.

"Yes."

"Good. You should be." She turned to face him fully. "Afraid people pay attention."

They had reached the place where the fondamenta forked — the same fork where, a year ago, they had parted. She had gone right toward the Contarini house and he had gone left toward the landing, and the half pace between them had been the width of the lagoon. He remembered the way her glass beads had caught the light of the last lit furnace and then gone dark as she passed it, and how he had stood there watching the place where the light had been.

She did not turn right.

She stepped toward him. The half pace vanished. Her hand came up — not to his face, not to his collar, but to his chest, to the precise spot where the yellow circle was stitched to his doublet. She laid her palm flat over the badge. He felt the pressure of it through the cloth, her calluses — quill calluses, ink-stained, the pad of her middle finger ridged from years of gripping — pressing the yellow wool against his sternum.

She was looking at the badge. At her own hand covering it. Her fingers spread slightly, as if she were measuring its circumference by touch, the way Enzo measured a lens blank before the first cut. Then she looked up.

Her eyes were the color they always were — hazel, green-flecked, lighter at the center — but he had never seen them from this distance, which was no distance at all. He could see the freckles across her nose so clearly they looked like a scattering of cinnamon on pale stone. He could see the small scar above her left eyebrow where the furnace door had caught her when she was twelve. He could smell ink and linen and the faint sweet resin of the soap they used in the Contarini household, and beneath that the salt of the lagoon air, which was on everything, which was on everyone, which tonight smelled like her skin specifically and no one else's.

She kissed him.

Her mouth on his was hard and brief and precise — the way a lens grinder's hands are precise even when they are shaking, the way a cut is precise because it has to be, because imprecision means ruin. Her lips were dry from the wind and tasted of salt and the faint char of furnace smoke that settled on everything in Murano, on stone and skin and glass alike. The glass beads at her throat pressed against his collarbone, small and round and warm from her body. He felt each one.

His hands. He did not know what to do with his hands. They hung at his sides for one terrible moment, grinding calluses and all, trained for precision and now shaking with the specific tremor of a man holding nothing when he needs to hold something. Then his right hand came up and rested at her waist, on the rough linen of her dress, and his left hand — the one that still carried the memory of her palm on its back from the counting room — his left hand closed around her wrist where it pressed against his chest, where her hand still covered the yellow circle, and he held it there.

The kiss lasted three seconds. Four. Not long enough for breath to become a question. Hard and specific and over before either of them had finished arriving in it. She pulled back first. He let go of her wrist.

They stood apart.

The fondamenta was empty. The canal water lapped against the stone with a sound like a tongue clicking, regular and indifferent. The furnace light — that last furnace, the one that had darkened her beads a year ago — threw its orange glow across the twenty feet between them and its source, and her glass beads caught it and held it, each one burning its own color, amber and cobalt and a green so dark it was nearly black, lit from within like eyes that know what they have seen.

Her hand was no longer on his chest. The yellow circle was visible again, the wool slightly pressed where her palm had flattened it. He could still feel the warmth. Specific as a burn. In the precise place where she had laid it down.

She breathed. He breathed.

"I'm not sorry," she said.

"No."

"I won't be."

"No."

The air between them was not the half pace. The half pace was gone and would not come back, and what replaced it was not closeness but knowledge — the kind that could not be unfixed, the kind that, like a crack in a glass vessel, propagates in only one direction. They had crossed a line that was not a line on any map of Murano, that was not written in any of the Council's regulations or the Rabbi's cautions or the laws of the Republic that said what a Jewish apprentice could and could not touch. They had crossed it and they were still standing on this fondamenta and the water still moved and the furnace still burned and nothing outward had changed except that everything had.

In the heat, she had told him a year ago, everything is compatible. Everything flows together. It's in the cooling that the truth comes out.

The sky above Murano was the color of spent charcoal. The first star appeared above the bell tower of Santi Maria e Donato, and the evening air was already cooling, and the truth — whatever it was, whatever it would cost — was coming.

"Walk me back," she said.

They walked. Not half a pace apart. Not touching. At a distance that had no measure, that fit no coefficient, that was the space between two people who have agreed, without saying so, to break together rather than cool apart.

At the fork she turned right. He did not turn left. He stood and watched her go, and the glass beads at her throat caught the light of the last lit furnace, each bead burning, and this time when she passed it and the beads went dark, he did not look at the place where the light had been. He looked at her. He watched until she turned the corner of the Contarini wall, until even the sound of her steps was gone, and then he stood a moment longer in the dark and the smoke and the smell of salt water, with the yellow circle on his chest and the warmth of her hand still on it, and then he turned, and walked toward the landing, and did not look back.
