The oar-lock groaned below as a gondola scraped the canal wall, and Enzo stood on the landing with the key already turning, his shoulders still carrying the salt-damp of the crossing from Murano. The door gave its familiar resistance — swollen wood, the frame warped by decades of acqua alta — and then he was inside, touching the mezuzah on the right doorpost with two fingers and pressing them to his lips before he registered that the room was dark.

No fire in the brazier. No smell of cooking.

His mother's shawl was gone from the hook, her delivery basket missing from beneath the table. Tuesday. She would be at the Contarini house collecting linens, or returning them — he could never remember which direction the cycle ran. He struck the flint and lit the oil lamp on the table, and the room assembled itself in pieces: the wooden stools pushed neatly in, the shelves with their careful separation of dishes, the dried rosemary and sage hanging from the ceiling beam in brittle bundles that Mirela refused to replace because they had been hung in the last month of his father's life.

The workbench occupied the wall beneath the window as it always had. Giacomo's grinding wheel, the wooden frame darkened with years of oil from his hands, sat with its pedal angled as though he had just stood up. The brass forms were arranged by size. The calipers lay crossed. Everything positioned with the deliberate care of a woman maintaining a shrine she would never call by that name.

Enzo set the lamp on the table and crossed the room. He had sat here before — dozens of times in the two years since the explosion, running his fingers over the tools the way other sons might visit a grave. Those early visits had been devotional, a boy touching relics he only half understood. He would hold the calipers and try to remember his father's hands closing them around a lens blank. He would press his palm flat against the grinding disc and feel nothing but cold stone and grief.

Tonight the room was the same. He was not.

Three weeks with Viaro's papers. Fra Giordano's lens diagrams spread across the table in that dim Venetian wine shop, the optical geometries rendered in the friar's precise hand — convex and concave curvatures specified to fractions of a Venetian inch, focal distances calculated, the entire architecture of concentrated light laid bare like the blueprints of a cathedral. Enzo had studied them until the mathematics lived behind his eyes, until he could look at a curve and feel its focal point the way a musician hears pitch.

He pulled the stool out and sat at his father's bench.

The leather tool case was where it always was, tucked between the grinding wheel's frame and the wall. Giacomo had made it himself — good calfskin, double-stitched, with loops inside for individual lenses and a drawstring top that cinched tight against dust. Enzo had opened it before. The lenses inside were test pieces, ground to various curvatures as references against which working lenses could be compared. A glassmaker's library, Giacomo had called them once, years ago. Every curve you'll ever need.

Enzo loosened the drawstring and tilted the case toward the lamplight. Eight lenses nested in their loops, each in a felt sleeve. He drew out the first and held it between thumb and forefinger, tilting it so the flame caught its surface. Standard convex, perhaps a three-inch focal length. Clean work. The kind of lens any competent grinder on Murano could produce.

The second was the same. The third.

The fourth stopped him.

He turned it in the light, then closed his eyes and ran his thumb across the curve. The motion was new — a slow diagnostic sweep that read a surface through skin rather than sight. A properly ground lens described a single, continuous arc. This one didn't. Beneath his thumb, so subtle that his untrained hands would never have caught it, the curvature deviated. Not at the edge, where errors commonly occurred. At a point roughly two-thirds from center, the radius shifted — tightened almost imperceptibly, then eased back to the original arc before reaching the rim.

He opened his eyes. Held the lens at arm's length and sighted the lamp flame through it. The image was clean. No visible distortion. Anyone inspecting this lens by eye, even an experienced grinder, would pass it without comment.

But Enzo had spent three weeks learning what happened to light at high magnification. He understood now how a concentrating system worked — multiple lenses in series, each one amplifying the precision or the error of the one before it. At low power, this deviation would vanish into the general softness of the image. At the focal intensities Fra Giordano's weapon required, it would scatter the beam like a stone dropped into still water. The light would diffuse. The concentration would fail.

He checked the fifth lens. Clean.

The sixth carried the same flaw. Different location — closer to center this time — but the same deliberate shift in radius. His thumb traced it twice to be certain, and certainty came like a bell struck in a quiet room.

Not errors. Giacomo Sforno had not made errors. These curvatures were ground with the same care as the clean lenses, the same steady hand, the same patient hours at the wheel. The deviations were precise. Calculated. They were built to pass every inspection and defeat every function.

His father had been sabotaging the weapon lenses.

Enzo set the sixth lens down on the bench and pressed both palms flat against the wood, breathing. Through the thin wall, the Morelli children argued about something — their voices sharp and rhythmic, a familiar percussion. Canal water lapped at the foundations. The building creaked the way it always did when the tide shifted, old timbers adjusting to pressures they had borne for a hundred years.

He picked up the leather case again. Empty now, all eight lenses laid out on the bench in a row. The case should have weighed nothing. It did not. A slight heaviness remained, concentrated at the bottom, and when he pressed the base with his thumb, the leather gave in a way that leather over a flat wooden form should not. There was play in it. A softness that suggested space.

Enzo brought the lamp closer. The stitching along the base was Giacomo's work — tight, even, nearly invisible. But when he tilted the case and looked at the profile of its bottom edge, he saw what he had never thought to look for: the base was too thick. By perhaps the width of two coins stacked. The leather had been doubled, an inner layer glued and stitched to form a false bottom with a thin cavity between.

He worked his fingernail along the inner seam where the side met the base. The stitching here was different — not sewn through both layers but tacked in a way that allowed the inner flap to be peeled back. It resisted, the old glue tacky and reluctant, and then it gave.

Folded papers. Three sheets, pressed flat by years of compression, the edges soft and furred where they had rubbed against the leather. Enzo drew them out with fingers that were very careful and very steady and not steady at all.

His father's handwriting. He would have known it in the dark, by touch alone — the heavy leftward slant, the angular Hebrew letters mixed with Italian technical terms, the ink a particular shade of iron gall that Giacomo had mixed himself from oak apples bought at the Rialto. The pages were dense with notation. Diagrams of lens curvatures. Numbers.

Enzo set the pages on the workbench beside the eight lenses and the emptied case, and the lamplight fell across them all, and his father's handwriting waited.
