The first sheet unfolded with the sound of a wing beating once.

Enzo held it near the oil lamp, tilting the paper until the small, exact figures resolved under the yellow light. Numbers. His father's hand — he would have known it anywhere, the way the sevens crossed themselves, the fives that closed their loops tight as a grinder sealing a bevel. Curvature notations ran down the left margin in columns: radius, depth of cut, deviation from true. Standard practice for any lens grinder keeping honest records of his work.

But the fourth column made no sense.

He brought the page closer. The fourth column recorded a second set of measurements alongside each entry, and between the pairs his father had drawn small arrows — not decorative, not idle. Directional. Each arrow pointed from the specification to what Giacomo had actually ground, and beside each arrow, in script so fine Enzo had to squint, a number expressed the difference. The deviation.

The deviations were not random.

He knew this because he had spent eighteen months at the grinding wheel and three weeks studying Fra Giordano's optics. The anomalous test lenses — the ones he had just held in his hands, the ones that read true on the surface but would scatter light at focal distance — those same signatures lived in his father's fourth column, recorded with a calm precision that made Enzo's fingers go cold against the paper.

Giacomo had tracked every flaw he introduced. He had calculated them in advance, ground them with intent, and documented the results as methodically as a physician recording dosages. The surface reads true but the geometry lies. That phrase, written in Italian between two rows of figures, sat on the page like a stone at the bottom of clear water.

Enzo set the first sheet down. Picked up the second.

A sketch. Partial, unfinished, but unmistakable to anyone who had seen Fra Giordano's designs. His father had drawn a multi-lens array — not a single element, not a component diagram, but the full configuration. Three lenses in sequence, their focal relationships marked with dotted lines that converged on a point his father had circled twice and labeled, in Hebrew, *ha-moked* — the burning place.

Giacomo had understood the weapon. Not abstractly, not as a craftsman who grinds what he is told to grind and asks nothing. He had understood what the lenses did together, how the array concentrated and redirected, what would happen when the full system reached power. He knew what he was building.

And he built it wrong. On purpose.

The third sheet was not a sketch but a record — dates and measurements interspersed with fragments of thought, a craftsman's working log rather than any kind of confession. The entries spanned perhaps three months. Enzo read them in order, and as he read, the room around him — the dried herbs above, the kiddush cup on its shelf, the familiar tools spread across the workbench — all of it remained exactly where it was and became somewhere he had never been.

*Tested the third batch. Scattering at focal distance confirmed. The surface reads true but the geometry lies.* That phrase again, repeated from the calculation sheet, but here it sat among dates and batch numbers as though Giacomo had wanted to fix the principle in his own mind. Below it: *They will not see what I have done. The glass keeps its secrets better than men.*

The Hebrew sections came in bursts between the technical Italian, and they were different in kind — not prayer exactly, but written in the language his father used for speaking to God and to himself. Enzo's Hebrew was serviceable, learned at his mother's insistence, and he moved through the phrases slowly, sounding some of them under his breath.

*I will not grind what I cannot see the end of.*

A canal boat passed outside. Water slapped the foundation stones. Somewhere above, in one of the upper apartments, a baby began to cry — a thin, persistent sound that threaded through the walls and would not resolve into silence or into peace. The flame in the oil lamp pulled sideways in a draft Enzo could not feel, then steadied.

His hands were shaking. He put the pages down on the workbench and pressed his palms flat against the wood, the way he steadied a blank before grinding. The grain was cool. Familiar. Below his right hand, a gouge mark from a slipped chisel — he had made that mark himself, at fourteen, and his father had said nothing about it, only handed him the chisel again and waited.

He picked up the pages.

The later entries grew shorter. The dates compressed. His father's hand, which never wavered in the curvature notations, showed a hurried quality in the final lines — not less precise, but faster, as though Giacomo were writing against something. Against a deadline. Against a suspicion. Against whatever he had begun to understand about what his employers knew and when they would know it.

The last entry was dated. Enzo recognized the date. The night before the furnace explosion.

One line, written in Italian, in the same small exact hand, but with the pen pressed harder than anywhere else on any of the sheets, so that the ink had bled slightly into the fibers and the letters stood embossed on the reverse side, legible even from behind, as though the words had been trying to push through the paper and into the wood of the desk where they were written and into the stone of the building and into the earth below the building where they might survive what was coming.

*If the glass breaks wrong, remember what I told your mother.*

Enzo was on his feet. He did not remember standing. The pages lay on the workbench where he had dropped them or set them down or let them fall — he did not know which — and the oil lamp threw his shadow long and fractured across the wall where his mother hung the drying rosemary and the braids of garlic she bought from the old woman on the Strada Nova.

The glass breaks wrong. Not *if something goes wrong.* If the *glass* breaks wrong. His father had known that the lenses — his sabotaged, deliberately flawed lenses — might be tested. Might fail in a way that pointed back to the grinder. Might break wrong.

And the furnace had exploded.

Not an accident. Enzo pressed his fists against the edge of the workbench and leaned into them until the wood bit his knuckles and the ache traveled up through his wrists and into his forearms. Not an accident. The furnace had been made to explode, or allowed to explode, or arranged to explode around a man who had done what Giacomo had done — who had seen clearly and acted and been seen acting.

His father had feared it. Had expected it. Had written a note the night before, not to Enzo, not to God, but *through* Enzo to Mirela. *Remember what I told your mother.*

What had he told her?

The house was empty. The emptiness was specific — Mirela's absence had a shape in the room, the way a removed lens leaves its focal point hanging in blank air, a convergence with nothing at its center. Her shawl hung on the hook by the door. Her mortar and pestle sat on the shelf above the small brazier where she heated the remedies she made for the neighbors' children. The oil lamp on the table burned steadily, and the shadow of the dried herbs on the ceiling beam swayed across the plaster in a draft that came from nowhere visible.

Enzo looked at the tools on the workbench. His father's gouges, his father's calipers, the polishing forms worn to the exact curve of Giacomo's grip. He had inherited them. He had used them. He had believed, for two years, that they were the tools of a man who died in an accident — a man who ground lenses because he was told to grind lenses, who worked and did not ask and was killed by bad luck and a cracked furnace wall.

The tools had not changed. They lay in their leather roll, in the order Giacomo had kept them, in the order Enzo still kept them. But the man who had held them — that man Enzo was only now beginning to see. A man who understood the weapon he was building. Who chose, with full knowledge, to break it from within. Who introduced invisible flaws with the steady hand and trained eye of a master grinder, and who documented every deviation with the precision of someone who wanted, someday, for the truth to be recoverable.

A man who saw the end of it coming and had time to write one line.

The baby upstairs went quiet. The canal water murmured its idiot repetitions against the stone. Enzo gathered the pages, folded them along their original creases — his father's creases, pressed into the paper by Giacomo's own hands — and placed them inside his shirt, against his chest, where the paper took on the warmth of his body and lay flat against his ribs.

He needed to find his mother.
