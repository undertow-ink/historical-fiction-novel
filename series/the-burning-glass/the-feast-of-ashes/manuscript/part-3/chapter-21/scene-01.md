The dough yielded under her fists. Mirela worked it against the board with the heel of her palm, turned it, pressed again, her lips moving around a melody that had no words — one of those niggumim her own mother used to hum in the kitchen in Modena, before the trading routes dried up, before the move to Venice, before everything. The brazier in the corner threw uneven heat across the room, enough to keep the chill from settling but not enough to warm the damp that crept through the plaster walls each November. She folded the dough over itself. Flour dusted the front of her dress, caught in the creases of her knuckles where the skin had cracked and reddened from years of other people's laundry.

Enzo stood in the doorway.

He had been there perhaps ten seconds, perhaps longer, watching her work. The house smelled of rosemary and the canal — that particular Cannaregio blend of green and rot that you stopped noticing after the first year and never stopped noticing after the second. Dried herbs hung from the ceiling beam above the table, casting thin shadows in the brazier light. On the shelf behind her, the meat dishes sat separate from the milk dishes, each in their place, each where Giacomo had built the little wooden divider that still held after all this time, though one side had warped with damp.

"Mama."

Her hands did not pause. "There's soup. Sit."

"I'm not hungry."

"Sit anyway." She turned the dough again. "You look like you've been running."

He hadn't been running. He had walked here from Murano with the careful, measured steps of someone carrying something breakable inside his coat, which he was, though the breakable thing was not glass. The folded papers pressed against his ribs. He could feel the edges through his shirt.

He sat on the stool nearest the door. The wood creaked under him. Through the floor, he could hear their downstairs neighbor, old Binyamin, coughing the way he coughed every evening — a sound so regular it had become part of the architecture.

"What did Papa tell you the night before he died?"

The niggum stopped.

Her hands stopped. The dough sat half-turned under her right palm, a pale lump catching the light. She did not look up. She did not move. The only sound was the canal water lapping at the foundations and Binyamin's cough receding into a long, rattling silence below.

Then Mirela's fingers curled slowly back into the dough. She resumed kneading. Slower now. Deliberate.

"Why are you asking me this now?"

There it was — her way. A question for a question, always. She had done it his whole life: deflected, redirected, turned the conversation like she turned dough, folding it back on itself until you forgot what shape you'd been trying to make. But he was not a child asking why the other boys threw stones. He was eighteen years old, and his father's handwriting was pressed against his chest, and the words in that handwriting had rearranged the last two years of his life into a shape he did not recognize.

"Because I found his notes."

Mirela's hands went still again. This time the stillness traveled up through her wrists, her arms, her shoulders. She stood motionless at the board, a woman of forty-one who looked fifty, who had been old since the summer her husband's furnace became his grave. The kerchief over her hair had slipped back, showing the grey that streaked from her temples. The hamsa pendant at her throat caught a glint of brazier light as her breathing changed.

"What notes."

It was not a question. Her voice had dropped — not to a whisper, not yet, but to that lower register she used when speaking of debts, of landlords, of the things that could be taken away.

Enzo reached inside his coat and brought out the folded papers. He set them on the table between the flour dust and the Shabbat candlesticks that lived there always, waiting for Friday. The papers looked small. Ordinary. A dead man's handwriting on scraps that could have been inventory lists or letters or nothing at all.

Mirela wiped her hands on her apron. She did not touch the papers. She looked at them the way you look at a letter you have already read — not with curiosity but with recognition, with the particular dread of something you always knew would surface.

"Who else knows?"

And that question — not *what do they say*, not *where did you find them*, but *who else knows* — told him everything. She already understood what was written there. She had always understood.

The room felt smaller. The herbs overhead swayed in some draft he could not feel, and the shadows they cast moved across the table like slow fingers. Enzo watched his mother's face. She was looking at the papers still, her lips pressed together, the lines around her mouth deepened by the low light. She touched the wedding ring on her left hand, turning it. A habit. She turned it when she was calculating — how much flour was left, how many days until rent, how long a lie could hold.

"No one else knows," he said. "Mama. Tell me."

Mirela picked up one of the papers. She held it close to her face in the dim light, and he could see her eyes tracking the familiar handwriting, and he understood that she was not reading it for information. She was reading it the way you touch a dead person's clothing. She was reading it to be near Giacomo.

She set it down. She looked at her son. And the room — the herbs, the brazier, the divided dishes, the dead man's workbench against the wall — drew close around them, as if the house itself were leaning in to hear what it had held in silence for two years.
