Mirela's hands had not moved from the table.

That was what Enzo noticed first, before the words came, before anything came — her hands, which were never still, which knotted thread and stripped rosemary and smoothed his hair and worried the fringe of her shawl, lay flat against the wood as though she were holding the table to the earth. The oil lamp guttered once and steadied. Bundles of sage and thyme hung from the ceiling beams above them like small darkened fists, and beyond Mirela's shoulder, against the far wall, his father's workbench sat in its permanent silence: the grinding forms in their rack, the calipers crossed, the stool pushed back at the angle Giacomo had left it two years ago. No one sat there. No one touched the tools. The bench existed the way a grave exists, tended and abandoned at once.

"A man came," Mirela said.

Her voice had dropped below its usual register, into a place Enzo had never heard — not the voice she used for prayer or scolding or singing him to sleep when he was small, but something scraped clean. A whisper that was not a whisper. A voice that had practiced this telling in the dark for two years and still was not ready.

"The night before. Late. You were sleeping." She was looking at the workbench, not at him. "I heard the door. Your father went to answer it. I thought — I don't know what I thought. A neighbor, maybe. Someone from the furnace with a question about the morning's melt."

Enzo sat. His hands were in his lap beneath the table, the grinding calluses on his fingers pressing into the edge of the seat, and he willed himself to stay exactly as he was. To not move. To not speak. On the shelf behind Mirela, the kiddush cup caught the lamplight, its silver dulled to the color of old water.

"It wasn't a neighbor. The man was well-dressed — I could see that much through the gap in the curtain. A cloak with good wool, boots that had been oiled. He spoke softly. Not from the ghetto, not from Murano. I didn't recognize his voice." Her fingers, still flat. "He and your father talked in the main room. I was in the sleeping chamber. The wall between is thin, you know this, but they kept their voices down and I could only hear pieces."

She paused. Her right hand lifted — not to gesture but to find the hamsa pendant at her throat, the small silver hand that Giacomo had given her the year Enzo was born. She held it between her thumb and forefinger the way she held a needle: precisely, with the pressure only at the tips.

"I heard *the glass*. I heard *the Council*. Something about consequences — not the word, but the shape of it, do you understand? The way a man says a thing when he means *your life* but cannot bring himself to be so plain."

Enzo understood.

"They argued. Not shouting — the opposite. The way men argue when shouting would be safer, when what they are saying is too dangerous to give volume to. It went on a long time. I don't know how long. I lay in the dark and I listened and I couldn't make myself go out there, and I couldn't make myself stop listening."

The lamp popped. A moth had found the flame and died in it, a small dry sound like a finger snap, and neither of them flinched.

"The man left. I heard the door. Then nothing, for a long time." Mirela released the pendant. Her hand returned to the table, flat again. "Then your father came to the bedroom door. He stood in the doorway. He didn't come in. He knew I was awake — he knew I'd heard, or heard enough. He stood there and he said —"

She stopped.

The herbs on the ceiling turned slightly in a draft that Enzo could not feel. From outside, far away, came the sound of the canal — a boat's hull knocking against a mooring post, the loose rhythmic complaint of rope on wood. The mezuzah on the doorpost was a thin dark line at the edge of Enzo's vision, marking the boundary between this room and the corridor, between here and every other place in the world.

"*Im yikreh li mashehu* —" The Hebrew came out of her like a splinter finally working its way to the surface. She pressed on in Venetian: "If something happens to me, take Enzo and leave Venice. Go to your family in Modena." A breath. "Don't let the boy near the furnaces."

The words landed in the room and stayed there.

Enzo's calluses ground against the wood beneath the table. He could feel the grain of it, every ridge, the way his fingers could feel the imperfections in a lens blank when he ran them across the surface during the grinding. His father's voice, in his mother's mouth. His father's last instruction, delivered to a doorway in the dark. *Don't let the boy near the furnaces.*

"Those were his words," Mirela said. "Exactly. I have heard them every night since. I hear them when I fall asleep and when I wake up and in the hours between. They are more real to me than anything anyone has said to me in two years. I could not forget them if I tried, and I have tried, Enzo. Believe me that I have tried."

He believed her.

"The next day." She said it flatly, the way one says *the flood* or *the plague* — a catastrophe compressed into a date. "I was here, in this room, sorting lentils. I heard the sound. Everyone heard the sound. And I ran, and I already knew." Her eyes were dry. Whatever grief lived in her had gone past the place where the body could express it; it sat in her like stone sits in the earth, heavy and permanent and unseen. "I ran to the furnace and there was smoke and shouting and men carrying things out and I knew before anyone told me. A cracked crucible, they said. An accident. The heat finds the flaw."

She looked at him now. Directly.

"No one asked me anything. No one came to the door to offer an explanation or a threat or even a lie. Just — silence. And I thought: *Ha'shtikah hi magen.* Silence is a shield. I told myself this. I told myself that the man in the good cloak would see that I was quiet, that I asked nothing, that I accused no one, and he would leave us alone. I told myself that if I kept my mouth closed, the danger would pass over us the way the angel passed over the houses that were marked."

Her hands. Still flat.

"If I had spoken — to whom? The Council? A Jewish woman from the ghetto, accusing a man she couldn't name, of a crime she couldn't prove, connected to work she wasn't supposed to know about? They would have asked how I knew. I would have had to say what Giacomo was making, what he was involved in. And then they would have looked at you. The son of the man who knew too much. The boy who might know what his father knew."

She took a breath, and Enzo heard how carefully she took it, how she rationed the air as though there were not enough in the room for what she still had to say.

"So I chose silence. I chose it the way you choose which limb to cut when the body is poisoned — not because it is good, but because every other choice is worse. And then you apprenticed yourself to Bardolino. To lenses, not to glass, I told myself. Not furnace work. Not the same. But it was the same, wasn't it?" She was not asking. "It was always going to be the same. You carry his hands. You carry his eye. You carry the thing in him that made him look at a material and need to know what it could become, and I —"

She stopped again. Her hands lifted from the table for the first time, and she looked at them as though she did not recognize them, as though they belonged to someone who had failed at the one task they'd been given.

"I kept you safe by keeping you ignorant." The words came out slowly, each one set down like a foot on uncertain ground. "But you weren't safe. You were already in it. You were always going to be in it, and all I did — all my silence did — was make sure that when you walked into the fire, you wouldn't see it coming."

The room held them.

Enzo looked at his mother across the table, at her hands now hovering a few inches above the wood, at the hamsa pendant resting against her collarbone, at the dry grief in her face that was harder than any weeping he had ever seen. He looked at the workbench behind her, at his dead father's tools, at the stool where a man had sat and shaped glass with the same hands Enzo had inherited, and he understood two things at once: that his mother had been right to keep silent, and that her silence had saved nothing.

Both of these were true. Neither cancelled the other.

He reached across the table and pressed her hands down, gently, back to the wood, and held them there. Her fingers were cold. The flour on her knuckles was dry now, cracked in the creases. He did not let go.

"I know," he said. "I know, Mama."

The oil lamp burned. The herbs turned in their draft. Outside, the canal carried its slow cargo of water and sound and salt, and the mezuzah on the doorpost stood its watch, and the night came on, and neither of them moved from the table for a long time.
