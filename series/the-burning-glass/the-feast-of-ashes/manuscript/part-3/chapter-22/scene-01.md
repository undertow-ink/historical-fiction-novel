The canal water had frozen in the bucket by the door. Enzo noticed it as he entered — a skin of ice across the surface, catching the oil light like a poorly ground lens, warped and milky at the edges. He had been summoned at dawn by a boy who spoke Viaro's name as though it were a prayer he'd been taught phonetically, without understanding.

The room above the wine merchant's office smelled of ambergris before Enzo saw the man. That sweet, animal scent threaded through the damp and the canal stink and the tallow smoke, and it meant the Silk was already seated, already waiting, already arranged.

"You're cold," Viaro said. He did not stand. The gold ring on his right hand caught the lamplight as he gestured to a chair. "Sit. There's wine."

Enzo sat. The chair was good — carved walnut, Paduan work, too fine for this room with its water-stained plaster and its single shuttered window. Everything around Viaro existed in that dissonance: the beautiful object placed in the ordinary setting, the civil word that carried the uncivil threat.

"I won't keep you long. I know the crossing is unpleasant in this weather." Viaro poured wine into a single glass. He did not pour for himself. "The lagoon was rough?"

"Choppy." Enzo's hands were in his lap, the grinding calluses catching against each other. He pressed his thumbnails together until the crescents whitened. "The boatman cursed the whole way."

"They do." Viaro smiled. The scar on the left side of his jaw shifted — a pale seam that seemed to tighten when he was pleased. "I have news that I think will interest you."

The way he said *interest*. As though Enzo had choices. As though this were a conversation between men who could walk away from each other.

"The array is nearly complete," Viaro said. "The housing arrived from the Arsenal three days ago. Bronze. Beautifully machined. The secondary mirrors are mounted. What remains is the calibration of the primary optics — the convergence sequence that your father's notes describe."

My father's notes. Enzo kept his face still. Three weeks since he had found those papers hidden in the false bottom of his father's tool case — the diagrams in Giacomo's cramped hand, the calculations that proved the lenses had been deliberately misground. Three weeks since his mother had sat across from him at their table in the Ghetto Nuovo, her fingers laced tight as rope, and told him yes. Yes, your father sabotaged the weapon. Yes, that is why he died. Yes, I have known since the night they brought his body home smelling of the furnace.

"Fra Giordano has reviewed the specifications," Viaro continued. "He is satisfied with the optical path. But the final grinding — the primary lens, the compensating element — requires someone who can work to the tolerances your father established. Fra Giordano asked for you specifically."

"I'm an apprentice."

"You identified the chromatic flaw in the third element. An apprentice would not have seen it. Fra Giordano was quite clear on that point." Viaro lifted the wine glass — Enzo's wine glass, untouched — and turned it slowly, examining the way the lamplight moved through the liquid. A man who studied refraction for pleasure. "He called it an intuition that cannot be taught. I believe his exact words were 'the boy sees what glass wants to become.'"

The compliment sat between them like a baited hook dressed in bright feathers.

"When?" Enzo asked.

"The friar arrives on Murano in six days. You will work with him at Bardolino's furnace. I have arranged it with the maestro." Viaro set the glass down. "Bardolino was reluctant, as you might expect. He has become protective of you. It's admirable, in its way."

In its way. Enzo heard what lived beneath those words — that Bardolino's protection was a small and temporary thing, permitted only because it did not yet interfere.

"And if the calibration fails?"

"It won't." Viaro's voice did not change pitch or volume. It never did. "You will succeed because you are Giacomo Sforno's son, and because Fra Giordano's design is sound, and because the Republic requires it. These three facts together make failure an impossibility." He paused. "It would be very unfortunate if I were wrong about you, Enzo."

*You will die.* The translation was automatic now. Enzo had learned Viaro's language the way he had learned to read the stress lines in heated glass — by watching where the fractures formed.

"I understand," Enzo said.

"I thought you would." Viaro stood. He moved with an economy that Enzo associated with men who had been trained to use weapons — no wasted gesture, no unnecessary shift of weight. The dark silk of his doublet absorbed the lamplight. "Six days. Fra Giordano will bring the final specifications. You will have access to whatever materials you need. Bardolino's furnace, his tools, his annealing ovens. The guild has been informed."

The guild has been informed. Four words that closed a door Enzo had not realized he was still imagining open. He had thought — stupidly, childishly — that he might go to the guild. That Maestro Dandolo or one of the senior glass masters might intervene, might shelter an apprentice who came to them with the truth about a murdered craftsman and a weapon that should not exist. But the guild had been informed, which meant the guild already knew, which meant the guild had always known.

Viaro pulled on his gloves. Black leather, close-fitting, without ornament. "Is there anything you need?"

"No."

"You're certain? I want you to have everything necessary. The work is delicate. I would not want external concerns to distract you." He looked at Enzo directly, and his eyes held that quality Enzo had noticed at their first meeting — a warmth that was entirely performed, a kindness with no body behind it. "Your mother, for instance. She is well?"

The air in the room contracted. Enzo breathed through it. "She is well."

"Good. The Ghetto Nuovo can be difficult in winter. The damp. I understand the building where your family lodges has needed repairs." Viaro adjusted the cuff of his left glove with the precision of a man aligning an instrument. "If anything is required, you need only ask."

"Thank you."

"Of course." Viaro moved toward the door and stopped. "One more thing. You may encounter a Levantine merchant named Rossetti. At the Rialto, perhaps, or on the fondamenta. He has an interest in Murano glass that is — let us say — more than commercial. If he approaches you, I would appreciate knowing about it."

Enzo's throat tightened. Rossetti, with his easy manner and his trader's Italian and those calluses on his right hand that were not a merchant's calluses. Rossetti, who had found him watching Viaro at the Rialto and had said, with that half-smile, *You seem to be studying something more interesting than exchange rates.* Enzo had thought of Rossetti twice in the last week — had considered, in the desperate arithmetic of the trapped, whether a foreign merchant with no loyalty to Venice might be someone who could help.

"I don't know anyone by that name," Enzo said.

"Mm." Viaro opened the door. Cold air rushed in from the stairwell, carrying the mineral smell of the canal. "Memory is a curious thing. It sharpens when the need arises." He stepped through. "Six days, Enzo."

Then he was gone, and Enzo sat alone in the room above the wine merchant's office with the oil lamp guttering and the untouched wine going dark in its glass.

He pressed his palms flat on the table. The wood was scarred with old knife marks and ring stains. Ordinary damage, made by ordinary hands. He spread his fingers and looked at the calluses — the thick ridges on his thumbs and forefingers where the grinding wheel had built its own geography over years of work. His father had the same hands. Had. The past tense was a blade that never dulled.

Six days to calibrate a weapon that could burn ships in the harbor, set fire to sails at distance, turn the Adriatic into a killing ground of focused light. Six days, and then the array would work, and it would work because Enzo would make it work, because he had his father's hands and his father's eye and none of his father's courage.

He reached for the wine. He drank it in one long pull. It was Malvasia, sweet and strong, and it burned going down. He set the glass on the table and turned it slowly in his fingers, watching the lamp's flame bend and multiply through the curved surface.

Six days.

He stood, pulled his cloak tight against the cold that was already seeping through the walls, and went down the stairs to find a boat back to Murano.
