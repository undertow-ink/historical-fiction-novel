The grinding wheel turned under his palms and the lens blank shed its imperfections in a fine white dust that settled on his forearms like frost. Enzo worked the curve with both thumbs, feeling for the place where the glass thinned unevenly, where the rotation had left a ridge no wider than a hair. He found it. He corrected it. The blank grew smoother under his touch, approaching the geometry Viaro's specifications demanded — a double-convex form with a focal length he could calculate in his sleep now, a shape that would gather light and bend it toward a purpose he understood too well.

Bardolino stood at the adjacent bench, cutting a rod of lattimo into measured lengths. The shears snapped. He set each piece aside with the nine fingers he had left, his movements unhurried, his face turned away. Neither of them had spoken since the noon bell. The furnace breathed its orange heat into the workshop, and between the two of them the silence held a shape it had not held before — not the comfortable quiet of master and apprentice working in shared rhythm, but the careful quiet of two men who had looked at the same ugly thing and agreed, without words, not to name it aloud.

Enzo pressed the blank against the wheel and listened to it sing. A high, thin note. Almost pure. He adjusted the angle by a degree and the note sweetened, and he hated that his hands still loved this work.

He had returned from the meeting on the morning ferry, standing at the rail among fishwives and a priest who dozed against a crate of eels. The lagoon had been flat and grey under a sky that promised snow. He had watched Murano resolve out of the mist — the campanile first, then the line of furnace chimneys trailing their individual smokes, then the fondamenta where the boats nosed in — and the island had looked to him like what it was. A place you could not leave without permission. A place the Republic kept its glassmakers the way it kept its secrets: close, watched, under penalty of death.

The guild was no help. He had known this before Viaro confirmed it, but he had let himself half-believe that the Arte dei Vetrai might resist an order that bent their craft toward war. They would not. The guild existed by the Council's sufferance. Its officers dined with the same patricians who sat on the Ten. Maestro Dandolo, who led the guild council, had a nephew in the Provveditori — Enzo had heard Bardolino mention it once, years ago, in a tone that suggested the connection was useful and everyone pretended it did not exist. To bring his complaint to the guild would be to deliver it directly to the men who had commissioned the weapon.

He lifted the blank from the wheel and held it to the furnace light. The curve was clean. Through it, the workshop warped and bent — Bardolino's broad back stretched wide, the shelves of cooling glass elongated into ribbons, the world distorted but made brighter. He set the lens in the polishing form and reached for the rouge.

Bardolino. He could feel the man's presence at the next bench like a change in air pressure. Bardolino had kept him alive. Bardolino had taught him to read a melt by its color, to feel the moment when a gather was ready to blow, to trust his hands when his eyes told him one thing and his fingertips told him another. But Bardolino was also the man who had accepted the commission, who had made the components, who had — even if reluctantly, even if under threat — bent his mastery to the project. The confrontation had broken something between them and replaced it with something harder and more honest, but honesty was not the same as freedom. Bardolino could not extract them. Bardolino was a glassmaker on an island of glassmakers, and the Republic owned the island.

The rouge stained his fingertips red. He worked it into the surface of the lens in small circles, the pressure even, the motion meditative. His calluses — thick and ridged across both palms, cracked at the base of each finger — caught against the glass in a way that told him the surface was nearing its final polish. The lens would be beautiful. It would focus light with a precision that made the eye forget its own limitations. And someone would fit it into a housing, and that housing into a device, and that device would do what Viaro had described to Fra Giordano in the meeting Enzo was never supposed to witness.

Fra Giordano. The Church. He had let himself imagine, walking the fondamenta with his collar turned up against the damp, that perhaps the Dominican's involvement was unauthorized — a rogue friar pursuing his own fascination with optics, acting without his order's knowledge. But Viaro's deference to the man had been too practiced, too careful. A patrician of Venice did not defer to a lone friar. He deferred to an institution. The Dominican order knew. They had sanctioned this, or at least chosen not to prevent it, and the difference between those two things was smaller than the ridge he had just polished off the lens blank.

He set the finished lens in its rack beside the others. Five completed this week. Each one flawless. Each one an argument he was making against himself.

The yellow circle on his doublet caught the furnace light as he turned. Wool, sewn to cloth, law made visible — the mark that told every person in the Republic what he was before he opened his mouth. He could not walk into the Ducal Palace and demand an audience. He could not present himself to a magistrate and expect to be heard. He was a Jew, an apprentice, eighteen years old, and the institutions of the Republic regarded him as they regarded the fish in the lagoon — present, tolerated, taxed, and beneath the dignity of serious attention.

Rabbi Yehudah, then. The thought came to him as he wiped the rouge from his hands with a rag that had once been white. He could go to the ghetto, sit in the rabbi's study among the books and the smell of old binding glue, and lay it all before the old man. Rabbi Yehudah would listen. He always listened. He would stroke his white beard and turn the pages of whatever volume lay open before him and answer Enzo's confession with a question — *And what would you have me do with this knowledge, Enzo? What power do you imagine we possess?* And the answer would sit between them like a stone. None. The community had no power against the Council of Ten. To involve Rabbi Yehudah would be to place the knowledge in another pair of hands that could not use it, and those hands would be Jewish hands, and if the Ten learned that the ghetto knew their secret, the consequences would fall not on Enzo alone but on every yellow circle in Venice.

He could not do that. He would not.

The workshop door opened. Tomaso came in with a crate of silica from the storeroom, his shoulders set in the rigid way they had been set since the night he had caught Enzo where he should not have been. He put the crate down near the mixing table and looked at Enzo — a flat, appraising look, the kind a dog gives another dog it has not yet decided to fight or ignore. Then he looked at his father. Bardolino did not look up from the lattimo. Tomaso left.

Enzo returned to the wheel. Another blank. Another curve to grind.

There was Rossetti. The Levantine merchant with the soft voice and the hard questions about Murano glass. Carlo Rossetti, if that was truly his name — Enzo did not think it was, or at least did not think it was the whole truth. The man had come to the island twice now, asking about furnace techniques with the specificity of someone who already knew the answers. His hands were wrong. Merchants carried their history in their palms just as grinders did, and Rossetti's calluses spoke of something other than scales and ledgers. A sword grip, perhaps. A bowstring. Something that required sustained pressure across the meat of the hand. His interest in the optical work was too precise, his sympathy too available, his presence on Murano too convenient to be accidental.

Enzo was not fool enough to trust convenience. Not anymore. Rossetti might be an ally. He might also be another trap — a different conspiracy's instrument, no less dangerous for being aimed at the same target from a different angle. To trust him would be to hand a weapon to a stranger and hope the stranger pointed it at someone else.

The blank turned under his hands. The dust rose. Through the workshop's single high window, the December light was failing, going from grey to the darker grey that preceded the early winter dark. The furnace compensated, throwing its heat and its copper glow across the benches, the tools, the racks of finished work. Prison light. The same fire that had taught him everything he knew was the fire that held him here.

Every door he tried in his mind swung open onto the same corridor, and the corridor led inward, not out. The guild. Bardolino. The Church. The community. Rossetti. Each one sealed or dangerous or both. Which left only the direction he least wanted to go.

Above Viaro, there was someone. A patron. A member of the Council of Ten itself — one of the men who had conceived the project, who had chosen Murano glass as the instrument and Bardolino's furnace as the forge. That person had power. That person could, in theory, be reached, reasoned with, threatened, bargained with, or exposed. But to approach that person meant climbing deeper into the architecture of the thing Enzo wanted to escape. It meant learning more, not less. It meant making himself more valuable and therefore more trapped, moving toward the center of the conspiracy in order to find its weakest point.

The lens blank was almost done. He could feel it in the diminishing resistance under his thumbs, in the way the glass had begun to accept its shape with something that felt, against all reason, like willingness. He held it up. Through the double-convex curve, the furnace mouth appeared as a single concentrated point of light — brilliant, precise, unbearable to look at directly.

He set it in the polishing form and reached for the rouge again, and his hands, which knew nothing of mercy, began the final work.
