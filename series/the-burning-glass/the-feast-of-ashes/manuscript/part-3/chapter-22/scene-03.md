The shed leaned against the canal wall like something tired. Enzo had to duck under the lintel, and even inside the ceiling sloped so that he could stand fully upright only along the center beam. Crates of silica sand lined one wall, stacked three high. Coils of rope hung from iron pegs. The air smelled of tar and salt and the chalky dust of ground minerals — manganese, cobalt, the raw stuff of color before fire made it useful.

Serena was already there. She sat on an overturned crate, her cloak pulled tight, her breath visible in the cold. A single tallow candle on a shelf threw weak light across her face.

"How bad?" she said, without greeting.

He closed the door. The latch was a piece of rope looped over a nail. "They want me to calibrate the final optics. For the device."

"The one your father was working on."

"Yes."

"The one that killed him."

He did not answer. She watched him the way she watched a column of figures — not passively, but with the focused attention of someone looking for the error that would make everything reconcile.

"Can you refuse?"

"No."

"Can you delay?"

"Not much longer."

She stood. The crate scraped against the stone floor. In the bad light he could see the glass-bead necklace at her throat, each bead catching the candle differently — amber, cobalt, a deep red, a green so dark it looked black until the light moved.

"Have you told anyone else?"

"My mother knows. She's always known." He leaned against the door frame. The cold from the canal wall soaked through his doublet. "There is no one to tell, Serena. The guild knows. The Church is part of it. The Council commissioned it. Every door I try opens inward."

She was quiet for a moment. Outside, water lapped against the canal wall — a patient, stupid sound.

"You're telling me," she said.

"You're not a door."

"No." She looked at him. "I'm not."

She did not move toward the door. Neither did he. The candle guttered in some draft he could not feel, and the light rocked sideways across the shed, across the coils of rope and the sand crates and her face.

"Enzo."

"I know," he said.

She crossed the three steps. Her hand came up and pressed flat against his chest, over the place where the yellow circle was sewn to his shirt, the same gesture as the fondamenta, the same hand, the same deliberate pressure — but this time she did not stop there. Her fingers closed on the fabric and pulled.

He kissed her. Or she kissed him. The distinction was meaningless. It was hard and graceless, their teeth catching, her nose cold against his cheek. His hands went to her waist and he felt the rough wool of her cloak and under it the linen of her dress and under that the warmth of her body, the solidity of her.

She pulled back, not far. A breath's distance. Her eyes — hazel-green, the color of canal water in certain light — were on his. Her hand was still fisted in his shirt.

"This is stupid," she said.

"Yes."

"This makes everything worse."

"Yes."

She kissed him again. Her other hand came up to the back of his neck, her fingers cold and rough — quill calluses, he could feel them — and he felt the sound she made against his mouth, not a moan but a short hard breath like someone stepping into cold water.

His hands knew surfaces. That was what they were trained for — to read the grain of glass through fingertips, to feel the difference between a lens ground to forty-eight degrees and one ground to forty-nine. He brought that attention to her now without deciding to. The curve of her ribs through linen. The ridge of her spine. The place where her braid was pinned and the loose strand that had escaped it, the hair coarser than he had imagined, not silk but something with texture and resistance.

Her cloak fell. He didn't know which of them had unfastened it. She was working at the laces of her overdress with one hand, the other still gripping his shirt, and he reached to help but she shook her head — a sharp small motion — and he understood. She would do this herself. He watched her fingers on the laces, ink-stained, efficient, and the garment loosened and she pushed it down off her shoulders.

Then her hands were on him, on the hem of his shirt, pulling it upward, and he caught her wrists. Instinct. The yellow circle was sewn at the breast of the shirt, and he wore it even here, even in a shed in the dark, because it was the law and because the habit of it was so deep it had become part of dressing, like putting on shoes.

"Enzo," she said. "Take it off."

He let go of her wrists. She pulled the shirt over his head and dropped it on a crate beside them. The cold hit his bare skin and he drew a sharp breath, and then her hand — her palm, warm, callused — pressed flat against his bare chest where the badge had been. She looked down at her own hand against his skin. The place where the cloth circle always sat, that his body had carried like a brand since he was thirteen.

"I see it," she said. She was not speaking of the badge. She was speaking of the pale shape of it on his skin, the ghost where summer after summer the sun had darkened everything around the cloth but not beneath it. He had a yellow circle on his chest even without the shirt. She traced the edge of it with her thumb. He felt that touch in his teeth.

He reached for her. The shift she still wore was thin and he could feel the heat of her through it, the shape of her breasts and the hard points of her nipples from the cold or from this. She pulled the shift over her own head in one motion and his hands were on her bare skin and the shock of it — the amount of her, the reality — stopped his breath.

The glass-bead necklace lay against her sternum. Seventeen beads, each a year of her life, each a different color, each made by her father's hands. He could feel them when he pulled her against him, the small hard rounds pressing between their chests, warmed by her body.

They went down. Not gracefully. His knee hit the edge of a crate and he swore, and she made a sound that was almost a laugh but not quite, and then they were on the floor, on her cloak spread over the cold stone, and the angles were wrong and he shifted his weight and she shifted hers and her thigh came up against his hip. The floor was hard beneath them. He could feel the grit of mineral dust through the wool.

Her hands went to his breeches and then to her own skirts, and the practical business of it — fabric bunched and shoved aside, the ordinary difficulty of two bodies arranging themselves on a stone floor in a cold shed — kept it from being anything like what he might have imagined. He was aware of his own awkwardness, of not knowing where to put his knee, of the sound of his own breathing too loud in the small space.

But her hand found him and guided him and when he pushed into her she made a sound — low, guttural, almost a grunt — and her fingers dug into his shoulders and he held still because he could feel that she needed him to hold still. Her breath came in short bursts against his neck. After a moment she moved, a small rocking motion, and he followed it.

It was not long. It was graceless and urgent and the cloak bunched beneath them and his knee ached against the stone and he could feel the glass beads between them, pressed into his chest, each one a hard bright point of heat. Her hands were on his back and he could feel her calluses on his skin, the rough pads of her fingers, and his mouth found her neck and the freckles there — the freckles he had first noticed seven years ago across a furnace yard, amber-brown against her skin — and he pressed his lips to them as though they were script in a language he could read by touch.

She arched beneath him and her breath caught and she said something — his name or a word in dialect he didn't catch — and her hand came up to the back of his head and held him there, against her neck, and he felt her body tighten and then release, a single hard contraction, and the sound she made was quiet and private, a thing not meant to be overheard. He followed a few seconds later with his face still pressed to her throat, and the world did not change.

The cold came back first. It had never left, but he had stopped feeling it, and now it returned — the stone floor through the cloak, the air on his damp skin, the draft from under the door. He rolled off her and onto his back and the ceiling was there, low and dark, the beam close enough to touch.

They lay side by side on the cloak. Their breathing slowed. From outside, the sound of water against the canal wall, the steady mundane lapping.

Serena sat up. She pulled her shift back over her head, and the glass beads clicked softly as they settled against her chest. She reached for her overdress. Her movements were practical, unhurried. She did not cover her face or turn away from him.

Enzo sat up too. The yellow circle on his discarded shirt was visible on the crate where she had dropped it, the round of cloth bright even in the bad candlelight. A small sun. He looked at it and then looked at her looking at it.

"What now?" she said.

"I go back. I do the work."

She finished lacing her overdress. Her fingers were steady. "Send word through the usual way when you know more."

"And if it gets worse?"

"Then send word anyway."

He reached for his shirt. The fabric was cold. He pulled it over his head and the yellow circle settled into its usual place on his chest, covering the pale ghost on his skin that she had traced with her thumb.

"Serena."

"Don't," she said. Gently, but with a firmness he recognized. She would not have the moment turned into a declaration. She had chosen this with her eyes open, in full knowledge of what it was and what it cost, and she would not have it reduced to a scene from a poem.

He nodded. She picked up her cloak and shook the mineral dust from it and fastened it at her throat. She looked at him once more — a long look, not tender exactly, but thorough, the way one looks at a thing one is committing to memory.

Then she opened the door and the canal air came in, salt and rot and winter, and she left.

Enzo sat on the floor of the shed for a while longer. The candle was burning down. His shirt smelled of her — ink and the faint sulfur trace of the fornace that clung to everyone who lived near one. On the crate beside him, a dusting of silica sand had been disturbed where their hands had knocked against it, and in the grit he could see the print of her palm, the fingers splayed, clear as a signature.

He blew out the candle and sat in the dark. Two secrets now. The sabotage and the girl. Either one enough to destroy him, and together they made a thing more intricate than anything Viaro could design — because this trap, the one on the floor of a storage shed, he had walked into with his eyes open.

He stood and went out into the cold, and walked back toward the furnace.
