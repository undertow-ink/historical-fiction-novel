The beam had no color.

That was the first wrong thing. Enzo had expected fire — orange, red, the familiar palette of the furnace. But the light that passed through the final lens and struck the oak plank was white. Pure white, concentrated to a point no wider than his thumbnail, and where it touched the wood, the grain blackened and split and then the smoke came, thin and fast, and then the flame.

Three seconds. He counted without meaning to. Three seconds from light to fire.

Fra Giordano clapped his hands. A single sharp sound in the furnace yard, startling in the morning quiet. "There," he said. "There, you see it. The convergence is exact." He turned to Enzo with a face so open, so bright with discovery, that he looked like a boy who had found a frog in a ditch. "Your grinding. The curvature on the secondary element — you felt it, yes? When you were working the edge? The way it wanted to resolve?"

Enzo said nothing. The oak plank was burning steadily now, flame crawling outward from the point of contact in a widening circle. Someone should put it out. No one moved to put it out.

"Rotate the array," Viaro said. He stood ten paces back, in the shadow of the workshop's eastern wall, his arms folded across his dark silk doublet. The gold ring on his right hand caught the same sunlight that was feeding the weapon. "Show me the stone."

Fra Giordano gestured to the two arsenal workers who had carried the apparatus into the yard at dawn. They shifted the brass frame — the array of six lenses mounted in Bardolino's housing, angled on a pivot that allowed it to track the sun — and the beam slid off the burning plank and onto the flagstone beside it. The white point settled on gray stone.

The stone hissed. A sound like water on a hot pan. The surface darkened, then cracked, a fracture line racing outward from the point of focus. A chip of stone popped free and skittered across the yard. Where the beam held, the rock began to glow — dull red, then brighter, the minerals in the flagstone surrendering to a heat they had never been meant to absorb.

"Extraordinary," Fra Giordano said. He had moved closer to the beam, close enough that the heat must have been fierce on his face. The sleeves of his white Dominican habit were pushed back to his elbows, and he held his hands out toward the light the way a man warms himself at a hearth. "The ratio of concentration is — Enzo, you understand, the mathematics predicted this, but to see it made actual — the area of collection against the area of focus, we are achieving perhaps eight hundred to one. Eight hundred times the sun's natural intensity, gathered and resolved to a single point. It is —" He stopped. Shook his head. Smiled. "It is beautiful."

The stone was glowing orange now. A small crater had formed, the rock melting at its center. Enzo could feel the heat from where he stood, fifteen paces away. It pressed against his face like a flat hand.

He looked down at his own hands. The grinding calluses on his right palm, the fine white dust that never fully washed from the creases of his knuckles. He had shaped the secondary lens over four days, working with rouge on a cast-iron lap, checking the curvature against Fra Giordano's template every twenty passes. The friar's design called for a hyperboloid surface — a curve that existed in mathematical theory and, now, in glass that Enzo had polished to a precision of fractions too small to see. He had felt the rightness of it under his fingertips. The moment when the surface stopped resisting the template and matched it perfectly, an absence of friction so complete it was like pressing glass to water.

He had been proud of that. Four days ago, he had been proud.

"Enough," Viaro said. The arsenal workers covered the primary lens with a sheet of oiled canvas, and the beam died. The stone went on glowing for a long time. Fra Giordano crouched beside it, examining the crater, murmuring to himself about thermal conductivity and the properties of Istrian limestone. The burned oak plank sent a thin column of smoke into the spring air, sweet and acrid, the smell of a cookfire gone wrong.

Enzo became aware of Bardolino.

The maestro had not come into the yard. He stood in the doorway of the workshop, half in shadow, his broad shoulders filling the frame. He held something small in his left hand — the millefiori piece, the one he had made at nineteen, the one he kept on the shelf above his workbench. He turned it slowly between his thumb and the stump where the tip of his index finger had been. His face was unreadable. He watched the smoking plank, the glowing stone, the friar on his knees in the dust, and he said nothing, and after a moment he stepped back into the darkness of the workshop and was gone.

Viaro crossed the yard to where Enzo stood. The ambergris scent preceded him — sweet, animal, wrong in the open air where everything smelled of char and hot stone. He stopped beside Enzo and looked at the aftermath of the test with the expression of a man reviewing a ledger that has come out favorably.

"The Council is pleased," he said. "The Pregadi received Fra Giordano's report last week. The specifications exceed what was promised."

Enzo watched the stone cool. The glow was fading, orange to dull red to the color of old brick. "When?" he said.

Viaro glanced at him. A small, precise movement, as if Enzo had said something slightly out of turn at a dinner. "The Ottoman flotilla has been harassing Venetian shipping between Corfu and Modon since January. Twelve galleys, perhaps fifteen. They anchor at Zonchio to resupply." He paused. "By summer, the weapon will be mounted on a Republic galley. The Pregadi want a demonstration against the flotilla before the sailing season ends. August, perhaps. September at the latest."

Specific ships. Enzo heard the words and immediately saw the thing they meant — not galleys as abstractions, not Ottoman forces as a phrase in a dispatch, but wooden decks crowded with men. Rowers chained to benches. The beam finding the hull, the pitch between the planking catching first, the fire racing along the seams. Men in the water. Men not in the water. The smell would be different from burning oak.

He knew this because his body knew it, in the grinding calluses and the fine-tuned fingertips, in the muscles of his forearms that had shaped the lens that made the beam that burned the stone. His hands had done this. The beautiful, perfect curve of the hyperboloid surface — his work, his best work — existed now to set men on fire.

"You will continue with Fra Giordano on the remaining elements," Viaro said. "Two more lenses for the secondary array. Bardolino has the glass prepared."

"And if I don't?"

The words came out flat, uninflected, as if he were asking about the weather. Viaro's expression did not change.

"Your position in this workshop exists at the pleasure of the Council. As does Bardolino's license to operate. As does the residency permit that allows a Jewish apprentice to work on Murano rather than live in the designated quarter." He let each sentence arrive and settle, like stones placed on a scale. "You are not compelled, Enzo. You are relied upon. There is a difference, though the consequences of disappointing either can look similar."

Viaro touched the gold ring on his right hand, turning it once, and walked back toward Fra Giordano. Enzo heard their voices but not their words. The friar was pointing at the crater in the stone, gesturing with both hands, describing arcs in the air.

Enzo stood alone in the furnace yard with the smell of burning in his nose and the spring sun warm on his face — the same sun, the same light, gentle and diffuse, that had just been gathered and sharpened into a thing that melted stone. A sparrow landed on the rim of the water barrel near the workshop door and drank, tilting its head back after each sip. The smoke from the oak plank had thinned to almost nothing.

His father had stood in a place like this. Not this yard, not this furnace, but somewhere in the chain of workshops and storerooms where the earlier version of this weapon had been conceived, before Enzo was old enough to understand what Giacomo Sforno did with his days. His father had ground lenses too. His father had felt the same rightness of a perfect curve under his fingertips. And at some point — standing in a yard like this one, perhaps, watching a demonstration like this one — Giacomo had understood what the lenses were for, and he had made his choice.

He had chosen sabotage. He had introduced imperfections into the glass, subtle deviations from the prescribed curvature, flaws that would scatter the beam rather than focus it. And they had killed him for it. A furnace explosion on Murano, the investigation closed before it opened, the workshop sealed within the week. He had been fifteen.

Three years. He had spent three years in Bardolino's workshop, learning to see glass, learning to feel the difference between a surface that was good and one that was true. Bardolino had taken him in when no one else would take a Jewish boy with a dead father and a name that smelled of trouble. Bardolino had taught him the furnace, the pontello, the shears. Had fed him. Had cuffed him when he was careless and praised him when he was precise. Had stood between him and the other apprentices when they spat at the yellow circle on his doublet.

And Bardolino had built the housing for the weapon. Had cast the brass frame and fitted the pivot and mounted the lenses that Enzo ground. Bardolino, who stood in doorways holding the millefiori piece he had made when the world was simple, who said nothing and watched and withdrew into the dark.

Both things were true. Bardolino loved him and Bardolino had built the weapon. The Republic was his home and the Republic was building a machine to burn men alive. His father had been right to resist and his father's resistance had accomplished nothing except his own death. The lenses were the finest work of Enzo's hands and the lenses were an instrument of murder.

He could not hold all of it. No container was large enough. But it was all true, every piece, and none of it cancelled any other piece, and the sparrow drank from the barrel and flew away, and the sun continued to shine on the furnace yard as if nothing in particular had happened there.
