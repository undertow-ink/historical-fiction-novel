The shed smelled of rope and canal water and the brine that crept into everything along the fondamenta. Enzo sat on an overturned crate near the door, which he had left cracked to let in the gray afternoon light. He was early. He was always early now, because waiting gave him time to think, and thinking was the only thing left to him that felt like action.

Three days since the test in the furnace yard. Three days since he had watched the white point of focused light settle on oak and burn through it in three seconds, settle on stone and crack it open, settle on everything he had built with his hands and reveal what it was for. The weapon worked. Viaro's face had not changed — the same controlled satisfaction, the same steady eyes — but Fra Giordano had clapped like a child at a puppet show, and Enzo had stood in the yard with the smell of scorched wood in his nose and said nothing, because that was what the yellow circle required: silence performed on cue, gratitude for inclusion, the perpetual assurance that he was useful and compliant.

He pressed his thumb into the callus at the base of his right index finger, the ridge of hardened skin that the grinding wheel had built over two years. The sensation steadied him. He thought about what the focused beam would do to ships carrying men, and the thought did not require imagination. He had seen what it did to stone.

Summer deployment. That was what Viaro had said, his voice carrying across the furnace yard with the casual authority of a man discussing a shipment of cloth. The Ottoman flotilla at Zonchio. August, perhaps. September at the latest. The beam would not distinguish between soldiers and sailors, between combatants and the boys who hauled rope in the rigging.

He heard her footsteps on the stones outside before the door moved. Serena entered the way she always did, without hesitation, closing the door behind her and standing still for a moment while her eyes adjusted. She wore a plain linen dress the color of undyed wool, and her hair was tied back with a strip of leather. The glass-bead necklace caught what light there was — amber and deep blue, one bead for each year of her life, each made by her father's hands.

"You're brooding," she said.

"I'm sitting."

"You're sitting and brooding. There's a difference between sitting and thinking and sitting and brooding, and you are doing the second one." She crossed the small space and stood in front of him, close enough that he could smell the wood ash that clung to her dress from the furnace room. "What is it?"

"Nothing worth talking about."

She studied him. He had learned, in the weeks since they had first come together in this same shed, that Serena read faces the way her father read molten glass — watching for the moment the material revealed what it meant to become. She was better at it than Enzo was at concealing anything.

"You've been strange since Thursday," she said.

"I've always been strange. You knew that."

She did not smile. She sat on the crate beside him, close enough that her shoulder pressed his. The warmth of it went through the fabric of his sleeve. He wanted to turn toward her. He did not.

What he was considering would end this. Not the act itself — the act might succeed, might fail, might result in his arrest or his quiet disappearance into the canals that swallowed inconvenient men. But even success would invite scrutiny. Someone would look for the person who had betrayed the conspiracy, and the looking would uncover everything. His movements. His associations. Her.

A Christian woman bedding a Jew. In the Republic's law, she would bear the penalty as much as he. More, perhaps, because the law expected Jewish men to be predatory and Christian women to know better. Her father's standing in the glassmakers' guild — already fragile, already dependent on the good opinion of men who measured respectability by the width of its performance — would not survive it. Alessio Contarini would lose not merely honor but livelihood. The furnace. The commissions. The house.

Enzo thought of his mother in the kitchen in Cannaregio, pressing bread dough with her scarred hands, telling him nothing about the danger she had seen coming, protecting him through the simple brutality of silence. *Ha'shtikah hi magen.* Silence is a shield. He had resented her for it. He had not understood.

He understood now. The shield was not for the one who held it.

"Enzo." Serena's voice was quiet. "If something were wrong — truly wrong — you would tell me."

It was not a question. It was an offering: the chance to speak, wrapped in the courtesy of a statement he could let pass. She was giving him a door. She would not push him through it.

"I would," he said.

The lie sat between them, small and ordinary. She leaned her head against his shoulder. He let her. Outside, the canal lapped at the stones with its blind, persistent patience, and the afternoon light moved across the far wall like something leaving.

He would act. He would not tell her. He would carry the choice alone because that was what you did when you loved someone in a city that had already decided what the two of you were worth. You became the silence. You became the shield. You repeated the pattern your mother had cut for you and called it protection, and you did not look too closely at the word, because if you did you would see that it was indistinguishable from the word *control*.

He kissed the top of her head, where the leather strip held back the dark auburn weight of her hair.

She let him. For now.
