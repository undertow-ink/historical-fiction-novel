The oar caught a crab and jerked in his grip, and Enzo corrected without thinking, the way his hands corrected for any flaw in the work — automatically, before the mind could intervene. The sandolo rocked and settled. He was halfway across the channel between Murano and Venice, alone in the pale hour before the city woke, and the water was the color of ash.

He had not slept. After they parted at the shed he had walked the fondamenta until the cold drove him indoors, and around the third hour he had come down to the Murano waterfront and untied the sandolo and pushed off without deciding where he was going. His hands had decided. They often did.

The lagoon at this hour was a flat grey plane broken only by the briccole — the channel markers rising from the water like fingers of the drowned. To the south, Venice was a dark mass against a sky just beginning to separate itself from the sea. To the north, Murano receded, its furnace chimneys not yet smoking. He was between the two, suspended in the unmarked water, and the only sound was the dip and pull of the oar and the faint slap of the lagoon against the hull.

He had been carrying it for weeks. Longer. Since the night he read Giacomo's notes and understood what his father had done to the lenses — the careful, invisible distortions ground into surfaces that would pass every inspection yet bend the light along false paths. Since before the notes, if he was honest. Since the first time he held one of Bardolino's components and felt in its precision the capacity for what it would do at range, to bodies, to ships full of men whose only crime was sailing under the wrong flag.

He pulled the oar and the boat moved and the water parted and closed behind him without a seam.

The calibration was nearly complete. Three more sessions, perhaps four, and the weapon would focus true — would gather the light of the sun and send it in a coherent line across the water to whatever the Council of Ten directed it toward. He had the skill to finish it. His hands knew the angles. His eye, Giacomo's eye, could read the interference patterns and adjust the secondary mirrors to within a fraction of a degree. He was, Bardolino had told him quietly one evening, the best natural opticist the old man had ever trained. Better than Giacomo. Steadier.

And that steadiness was the problem. Because his hands would do what they were trained to do. They would complete the calibration. They would make the weapon sing. And then some morning a galley would round the point of the Lido and the light would find it, and the pitch in its seams would catch, and the sails would catch, and the men on its deck would catch, and they would burn.

A heron lifted from one of the briccole and crossed low over the water ahead of him, its wings broad and unhurried, and vanished toward the marshes of Sant'Erasmo.

He could finish the work. He could tell himself that the weapon was Venice's right — that the Republic faced real danger, that the Ottoman fleet had burned Otranto and would burn more, that defense was not aggression, that the lives the weapon saved would outnumber the lives it took. He could tell himself that Bardolino needed him, that the old man had staked everything on this commission and would be ruined if it failed, that loyalty to the man who had fed him and housed him and taught him was not a small thing but the largest thing, the debt that shaped a life. He could tell himself that Serena was right to say, as she had once said, that the world was not a glassworks where flaws could be ground away, that power existed and would be used and the only question was by whom.

He could tell himself all of this because it was true.

The sky was lightening. A band of copper lay along the eastern horizon, and the water had taken on the faintest green, and he could see now the individual stakes of the briccole and the dark shapes of fishing boats heading out from Burano to the north. The lagoon was waking. The day was coming whether he wanted it or not.

He shipped the oar and let the sandolo drift.

His father had made his choice alone, too. Giacomo had stood at his grinding wheel and had introduced into each lens a deviation so subtle that no inspection would catch it — a thousandth of a degree here, a fractional asymmetry there — and had done this knowing that if the weapon were ever tested at full power the flaws would compound and the beam would scatter and the thing would not work. And Giacomo had been right. The flaws held. The weapon never focused. And then someone — Enzo did not know who, might never know who — had understood what Giacomo had done, and the furnace had exploded around him, and the Council had called it a cracked crucible, an accident, the heat finding the flaw, as though a furnace that had run true for years would simply decide to break. And Enzo's mother had taken her son and her silence and gone to the ghetto and had not spoken of it again.

*Ha'shtikah hi magen.* Silence is a shield.

But it was not a shield. It was a sarcophagus. His mother had sealed herself inside it and lived there still, and Enzo had grown up breathing the dead air of her protection, and he understood now — adrift on the grey water, the boat turning slowly in the current — that his mother's silence had not saved Giacomo and had not saved her and would not save him. It had only made the sacrifice invisible. It had let the Republic pretend that nothing had happened, that no one had resisted, that the machine had merely malfunctioned and could be rebuilt.

And it had been rebuilt. Here he was. Giacomo's son at Giacomo's work, finishing what his father had died to prevent, because Bardolino had seen the talent in a grieving boy and had not been able to leave it alone.

The sandolo had drifted off the channel. He could feel the shallowing in the way the hull moved — a different resistance, the water thickening over the mudflats. He took up the oar again and corrected his course, aiming for the bell tower of San Giorgio Maggiore, which stood now in silhouette against the brightening sky like a dark pin holding the city to the earth.

Bardolino. He let himself think the name and feel what it carried. The old man's hands guiding his hands over a lens blank for the first time. The patience. The evening meals in the kitchen with the furnace heat still radiating from the workshop wall. The trust. Bardolino had built the weapon's housing, its armature, its tracking mechanism — had given years of his life to it — and if the calibration failed now, after Enzo's work, the Council would not look kindly on the old craftsman who had vouched for his apprentice. They would look at Bardolino and see a man who had harbored the son of a saboteur and handed him the keys.

This was the cost. Not only his own life but the old man's. Not only his future but Bardolino's past — every year of faithful service weighed against the suspicion that he had known, that he had planned it, that the apprentice had been a weapon aimed at the weapon all along.

And Serena, whom he had kissed hours ago and left without telling her what he was going to do, repeating his mother's pattern so precisely that it sickened him even as he did it. She would be questioned. She would have nothing to give them, which might protect her or might not. He was gambling with her life the same way Giacomo had gambled with Mirela's, and the justification was the same — what she does not know she cannot betray — and the cruelty was the same, and he was doing it anyway.

A barge passed him, heading north toward Murano, loaded with wood for the furnaces. The bargeman raised a hand. Enzo raised his. Two men on the water at dawn, ordinary, unremarkable. The yellow circle on Enzo's doublet was just a patch of color in the grey light, visible only if you knew to look for it. The surface reads true.

He picked up his stroke again and pulled toward Venice. The copper band on the horizon had widened into full dawn, and the city was emerging from its silhouette into color and dimension — the pink of the Ducal Palace, the white of San Marco, the dark green of the water along the Riva. Somewhere in there the Arsenal was stirring, and the Council was meeting, and the gears of the Republic were turning as they turned every morning, indifferent to the small agonies of the men caught in them.

He was not going to finish the calibration.

The thought arrived without drama, without the sound of a door closing or a bell tolling or any of the other portents that should attend a man signing his own death. It arrived the way a crack arrives in glass that has been cooling unevenly — not at the moment of stress but after, when the material has already committed to its shape and the internal tensions have nowhere left to go. The fracture does not choose its moment. It was always going to happen there, along that line, in that exact configuration. The only question was when.

He was going to do what Giacomo had done. He was going to make the surface read true while the geometry lied. But he was going to do it better, because he had Giacomo's example — both the method and the warning. His father had been brilliant and had been caught. Enzo would need to be more than brilliant. He would need to be invisible. He would need to introduce flaws so deep in the optical path that they would be undetectable by any test short of full deployment, and by then it would be too late, and the scattered light would tell no story except failure.

He did not yet know how. The specifics were a problem for tomorrow, for the workshop, for the long hours with the grinding wheel and the calipers and the wax models of the mirror arrays. He knew only the decision, and the decision was enough. It sat in him now the way glass sits in its mold after the annealing — rigid, clear, carrying its stresses in perfect silence.

The sandolo entered the Canale di San Marco. The water changed color, darkened, took on the chop of the wider channel. Ahead, the quay at the Molo was already busy with boats unloading, and the first market vendors were setting up their stalls along the Riva, and the city was opening like a furnace door, releasing its heat and noise into the morning air. Enzo pulled the oar and the boat moved and the water parted and closed behind him, seamless, as though he had never been there at all.
