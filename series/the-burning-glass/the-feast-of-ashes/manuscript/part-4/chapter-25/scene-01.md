He lifted the first lens from its felt cradle with both hands.

Secondary lens three. Convex, twenty-four centimeters across the face, ground to a curvature of one-point-six meters. He knew its specifications the way he knew his own breathing — without effort, without thought. The glass caught the low light from the banked furnace and held it, amber pooling in the center where the thickness was greatest. He carried it to the workbench and set it down on the leather pad.

The workshop was quiet. Not silent — the furnace saw to that, its banked coals ticking and settling behind the iron doors, the masonry radiating a heat that pressed against his back like a hand. But the quiet of absence. Bardolino had left at the seventh hour. The two apprentices before that. The grinding team at the sixth. Enzo had stayed to finish calibrating lens seven, which was legitimate work, and then he had waited. An hour. Two. Until the footsteps on the fondamenta outside thinned to nothing and the only sounds were the furnace and the water lapping at the quay stones and his own pulse in his ears.

He brought the brass collar from beneath the workbench where he kept it wrapped in oilcloth. Four set screws, filed from a discarded hinge plate — Bardolino would have recognized the brass if he'd seen the jig assembled, would have known the hinge had come from the old annealing-oven door. But Bardolino would not see it. The collar lived in the oilcloth and the oilcloth lived beneath the bench and Enzo was the only one who worked this late.

He seated the lens. Turned each screw in sequence — top, right, bottom, left — until the glass sang that faint high note against the brass, the harmonic of proper contact. No play, no rattle. The lens centered and held. He checked the seating by running a fingertip along the rim where glass met metal. Smooth. True.

Then he stopped.

His hands were steady. He looked at them in the furnace-glow and willed them to stay that way. The left bore grinding calluses across the heel and the first two fingers, the skin there thick and silvered with embedded grit that no amount of washing would remove. His father's hands had looked the same. He had been seven when he'd first noticed the resemblance, holding his own small palm up against Giacomo's broad one, matching callus to callus.

He loosened the leftmost screw by a quarter turn.

The click of brass thread against brass thread was very small. He tapped the rim of the lens with the ball of his thumb — one tap, controlled, the pressure distributed through the pad of flesh so the glass would rotate without chipping. The lens moved. A fraction of a degree. Less than the width of a hair at the rim, but at distance, through the array, that fraction would compound. Each secondary lens fed into the next. Errors multiplied through the chain like a lie repeated, growing less plausible with each telling until the whole story fell apart.

He retightened the screw. Snug, not tight. Enough to hold the lens in its new position, not enough to shift it further. He lifted the collar and carried it to the far end of the bench where he'd set a candle — tallow, not beeswax, because the flame was dirtier and brighter and threw a wider cone. Fifteen paces. He'd measured with a length of cord knotted at intervals.

He held the lens up in the collar and sighted through it at the candle flame. The image formed where it should — the focal geometry was unchanged, the curvature unaltered. His father had worked at the surface level, grinding errors into individual lenses, changing curvatures by fractions that could be detected under magnification. They had caught Giacomo because each lens, examined alone, revealed its flaw. A patient man with a loupe and a reference curve could test every element in the array, and someone had.

The surface reads true but the geometry lies.

Enzo's alteration touched nothing that a loupe would find. The lens itself was perfect. Its curvature was what the specifications demanded. Its polish was flawless. Only its position in the mount had changed — a rotational displacement so slight that the mounting pins would still engage, the felt cradle would still receive it, the calipers would still read the same diameter at the same orientation marks. But when sunlight entered the array and passed through this lens on its way to the next, the beam would strike the following element a hair's breadth off-center. And that element would pass it to the third, and the third to the fourth, and by the time the gathered light reached the focusing stage, the coherence would be gone. Not scattered. Not obviously wrong. Simply diffuse. A beam that should have been a needle would be a thumb. A weapon that should have burned through sail canvas at three hundred meters would produce, at best, a warm glow.

He brought the lens back to the workbench. Loosened the screws in reverse order — left, bottom, right, top — and lifted the glass free. He held it up to the furnace light one more time, turning it, reading the surface. Perfect. Indistinguishable from what it had been an hour ago, because it was what it had been. The glass had not changed. Only its relationship to the housing would change, and that change lived not in the lens but in the mount, in the tiny asymmetry of the screw tension that would hold it a fraction off true when the array was assembled.

He set the lens back in its felt cradle. Pressed the felt around its edges until it sat exactly as it had before — the same slight impression in the nap, the same orientation to the rack. Fourteen lenses in the rack, each in its numbered slot, each nestled in felt that Bardolino had cut and fitted himself because he trusted no one else with the bedding. Enzo lifted his hands away and studied the result. Lens three sat in its place as though he had never touched it.

He wrapped the brass collar in its oilcloth and returned it beneath the bench. Then he stood in the middle of the workshop and breathed.

The wrongness was in his hands. Not trembling — they did not tremble — but a sensation like a tone struck in the muscles of his fingers, a dissonance that traveled up through his wrists and forearms and settled in his shoulders. Every motion of the sabotage had demanded the same control as his finest calibration work, the same steadiness, the same attention to fractions. But aimed in the wrong direction. He had spent eleven years training his hands to make glass true, to find the precise curvature, the exact polish, the correct alignment. To bring his hands to this — to use their skill for deliberate imperfection — was like forcing a singer to hold a note just flat enough to sour a chord. The body knew it was wrong. The body resisted. He had to override the resistance with each motion, press through it the way a grinding arm pressed through the last layer of polish when the glass was almost there but not quite.

He flexed his fingers. Closed them into fists and opened them. The furnace heat was on his face now and he realized he had turned toward it without meaning to, the way the body turns toward warmth when the cold is not outside but in.

One lens. The first of five.

Four more sessions. Spaced three days apart at minimum, four if the workshop schedule demanded it. Interleaved with the legitimate calibration that Viaro expected and Bardolino supervised. Six weeks. Maybe eight if the master kept him late on the housing fittings, which needed a second round of shimming after the trial assembly in September had shown gap variance along the left rail. Real work. Work he was good at, work that kept his hands honest and his presence in the locked room unremarkable. The calibrator, working late. Nothing more.

He took the key from around his neck and locked the component room. The lock was heavy, Venetian-made, three wards. Viaro had given him the key in August with a nod and no ceremony — you are the calibrator, you need access, here. Enzo had not asked for it. Had not maneuvered for it. The work itself had earned it, which made the betrayal precise. He was using the trust his skill had built to do the thing his skill existed to prevent.

He hung the key back inside his shirt, against his chest. The metal was warm from his skin.

The walk to the quay took two minutes. The fondamenta was empty — no lamplighters this late, no glass-workers stumbling between taverns. Murano after midnight was a place of closed shutters and furnace smoke, the air sharp with sulfur and the alkaline bite of soda ash. He untied his sandolo from the mooring post and stepped in. The boat rocked once beneath his weight and steadied.

The crossing to Cannaregio would take twenty minutes if the tide was with him, thirty if it was not. He dipped the oar and pulled. The water was black and flat. Somewhere ahead, past the northern edge of the cemetery island, his mother was sleeping in the house on the Calle del Forno, the yellow circle she wore to market folded in the drawer beside her bed. The same circle sewn to Enzo's doublet, the cloth slightly stiff where the stitching pulled.

He rowed. The furnace glow of Murano fell behind him, and the dark of the lagoon opened ahead, and his hands on the oar were steady. They would be steady for the next session and the one after that and the two after that. Whatever the wrongness cost him, it would not show in his hands. He would not allow it. His father's hands had been steady too, right up until the furnace took them, took everything, took the hands and the man and left behind a story about a cracked crucible that everyone agreed to believe because the alternative was worse.

Four more lenses. He counted them the way he counted strokes of the oar — forward, pull, recover. Forward, pull, recover. The rhythm of work that could not be rushed and would not be stopped.
