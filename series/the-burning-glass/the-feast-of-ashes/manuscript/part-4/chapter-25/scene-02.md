Enzo set the third lens into its brass collar and turned the calibration screw one-eighth clockwise. The click of the detent was small and clean, the sound of a thing finding its place. He held the lens there, checked the angle against the graduated arc etched into the frame, and read the number: fourteen degrees, forty minutes. The approved tolerance. The number Fra Giordano had calculated in his notebooks, the number the Council had signed, the number that meant the weapon would work.

He wrote it in the logbook. His hand was steady. The ink dried in the autumn air that came through the workshop's high windows, carrying the smell of the lagoon and the furnaces beyond.

The lens was not at fourteen degrees, forty minutes. It was at fourteen degrees, thirty-seven minutes. A difference so slight that no instrument in the workshop could detect it at arm's length, and no eye — not even Fra Giordano's — could see it by looking. But light was not forgiving. Light remembered every fraction, carried every error forward, and at distance the error would multiply. Three lenses now, each shifted by a different value, each in a different rotational plane. The beam would still converge. It would still burn. But its focal point would smear across an area too wide to do what the weapon was designed to do, which was to set fire to a ship's rigging at four hundred paces.

At forty paces it would still kill a man. At four hundred it would be a bright warmth on sailcloth, nothing more.

He dipped his pen again and recorded the collimation for the secondary element. Another true number laid over a false position. The logbook was becoming a document of extraordinary precision and total deceit, each entry correct in isolation, each referring to a lens that had been quietly moved from where the entry said it was.

Fra Giordano leaned over the array. His white sleeves were bunched at his elbows, the wool stained with chalk dust from the calculations he had been working on the slate board in the corner. He held a hand lens — his own, Venetian glass, beautifully ground — and peered through it at the secondary element Enzo had just set.

"Good," he said. "Good, good." He straightened and made a note on his own sheet, his handwriting a rapid scratch that only he could read. "The ratio holds. You see? The ratio always holds. That is the beauty of it, Enzo. Men argue about many things — God, money, the price of salt — but the ratio of a convergent series is not subject to argument. It simply is."

He smiled. His face was long and lean, the face of a man who ate poorly and thought constantly, and when he smiled it transformed into something almost gentle. He picked up the tertiary lens — the one Enzo had rotated nine days ago, the first of the five — and held it between his thumb and forefinger, tilting it so the window light passed through.

"This glass," he said. "This is why I insisted on Murano work. A Florentine would have given me bubbles. A German would have given me color. This is clear as water. Clearer." He held it up to his eye and looked through it at the far wall. "When I was a student in Padua, my teacher told me that perfect transparency was impossible. That all glass carried some memory of the fire that made it. I believed him for years. Then I came here."

He set the lens back into its housing with a care that was close to reverence, his fingers finding the seat by touch. Enzo watched those fingers and felt the sweat start between his shoulder blades, a slow cold line tracing down his spine. The friar was holding the sabotaged lens. He was looking through it. He was putting it back.

He noticed nothing.

"Shall we test the short array?" Fra Giordano said. He was already moving to the end of the workbench, where a target board stood propped against a brick column — a square of seasoned oak marked with concentric rings in lamp black. "The light is good this morning. We can check the focal resolution at bench distance."

"Of course, Father."

Enzo unlatched the array from its calibration mount and carried it to the testing cradle at the bench's end. The cradle was a half-circle of iron that Bardolino had forged to Fra Giordano's specifications, with a pivot that allowed the array to track laterally. He settled the frame into it, checked the pivot tension, and angled the array toward the window. A bar of autumn sunlight fell across the primary lens and passed through, gathering, bending, converging through the secondary and tertiary elements. On the target board, four braccia away, a point of light appeared. Bright. Tight. Enzo could feel the heat of it from where he stood, a faint pressure on the skin of his forearm.

"Excellent," Fra Giordano said. He moved to the target and held his hand near the bright point, not touching it, feeling the heat as a physician might feel a patient's fever. "Tight convergence. Minimal scatter." He checked the diameter of the bright point against a ruled card he kept in his sleeve. "No wider than a lentil. Within tolerance."

At four braccia, it would be. The errors Enzo had introduced were designed to manifest at distance, where the angular displacement had room to compound. At bench range the beam was still clean, still lethal in its focus. Fra Giordano could test it here all day and find nothing wrong.

"I wonder," the friar said, stepping back from the target and looking down the length of the workshop. The space ran twenty-five paces to the far wall, where crates of cullet were stacked beneath a window. "If we moved the target to the back wall. Twenty-five paces is not four hundred, but it would give us some indication of how the focal integrity holds at range."

Enzo's hands were on the array's pivot housing. He did not let them tighten. He adjusted the lateral screw, a motion that required attention, that justified a pause before answering.

"The light angle is wrong for it, Father." He gestured toward the windows. They faced southeast, and the autumn sun was already tracking south, the bars of light falling at a steep diagonal across the workshop floor. "At that distance the beam path would cross three shadow lines from the roof beams. The interruptions would break the coherence before it reached the target. We would be testing the workshop's architecture, not the optics."

Fra Giordano looked up at the roof beams. He looked at the shadow lines on the floor. They were there, dark bars falling at regular intervals where the beams blocked the high windows. He frowned, calculating. Enzo could almost see the geometry assembling in the friar's mind — the beam path, the angle of incidence, the shadow interruptions. After a moment the friar exhaled and nodded.

"You are right. We need open sky for a proper range test. The Arsenal yard, when the full assembly is ready." He made another note on his sheet. "I will schedule it with the Council's office. Perhaps the first week of November, if the weather holds."

"That would be best," Enzo said. His voice was level. November was five weeks away. He needed three.

He returned the array to its calibration mount and began recording the short-range test results. The numbers went into the logbook in his careful hand: focal diameter, convergence ratio, heat index estimated by proximity. All true. All correct. All describing a weapon that, at the range it was designed to operate, would fail to do what its builders intended.

The workshop door opened and Bardolino came in, favoring his right leg, the bad knee stiff from the morning damp. The old maestro wore his leather apron over a wool shirt that had been patched at both elbows. He stopped near the workbench and looked at the array, then at Enzo, then at Fra Giordano.

"How does it progress?" he asked. A routine question. A master checking his workshop.

"Beautifully," Fra Giordano said. "Your boy has the finest hands on the island, maestro. The calibrations are exact."

Bardolino grunted. He reached out and touched the brass frame of the array, running a thumb along the joint where the housing met the pivot mount — his own work, his own craftsmanship. The housing was a masterpiece of precision metalwork, every seam tight, every surface trued. Bardolino had spent forty years building things that worked, and this was perhaps the finest thing he had ever built, and it was a weapon.

"The pivot is smooth?" he asked Enzo.

"Smooth and true, maestro."

"Good." Bardolino looked at the array a moment longer. On the shelf behind him, where it had sat for thirty years, was the millefiori paperweight he had made at nineteen — a sphere of glass containing a garden of colored flowers, each one placed with tweezers while the glass was still soft, preserved now in perfect clarity. He had told Enzo once that he had made it to prove he could make something beautiful. Everything since then, he said, had been to prove he could make something useful. Enzo had not asked him which category the weapon fell into.

The old man's stool was in its usual place by the workbench, turned slightly to the right so he could rise without catching his bad knee on the bench leg. He did not sit. He looked at Enzo with an expression that was not suspicion, was not even curiosity, but something older — the look of a man watching someone he had raised and wondering, as all such men eventually wonder, what that raising had produced.

"Don't keep Fra Giordano past midday," he said. "He forgets to eat."

He left. His footsteps receded down the corridor toward the furnace yard, uneven, the bad knee making each second step a fraction shorter, and with each step Enzo felt the distance open between them — between what Bardolino believed was happening in his workshop and what was actually happening, between the man's trust and Enzo's use of it.

Fra Giordano was already back at his slate board, chalking a new series of equations, murmuring to himself about convergence angles. The white dust rose from his moving hand and drifted in the bar of sunlight like something released.

Enzo turned back to the array. Two lenses left. He picked up his grinding cloth and began to clean the primary element, a motion so habitual that his hands could do it while his mind was elsewhere. The cloth moved in slow circles on the glass, and the glass was cool against his callused fingers, and the logbook lay open beside him with its perfect numbers, and outside the workshop windows the autumn light fell on Murano as it had fallen for centuries — on furnaces and canals, on men who made beautiful things and men who made terrible ones, and sometimes on the same men doing both at once.
