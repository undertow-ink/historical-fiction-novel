He was already inside — already past the door and its iron latch, already standing in the counting room with Serena seated at the table, her quill moving across a column of figures. She had not looked up when he entered. She did not look up now. The candle threw her shadow large against the plaster wall, and the shadow's hand moved steadily, recording sums that would not balance.

"You're late," she said.

"Yes."

She finished the line she was writing. He watched her hand — the quill's nib catching light, the ink glistening wet before it dried. Her handwriting was precise and small and legible, the hand of someone who had been keeping accounts since she was old enough to hold a pen. She set the quill in its holder and looked at him.

The counting room was narrow, barely wider than the table that filled most of it. Shelves along one wall held bound ledgers going back a decade, their spines marked with years in her father's broader hand. A second candle, unlit, sat in a dish of its own tallow. The air smelled of ink and rendered fat and the faint mineral grit that settled on every surface in Murano, that worked itself into cloth and hair and the creases of skin and could not be washed entirely away. Enzo carried it on him now — the fine pale dust of ground glass in the lines of his palms, under his nails, in the roughened skin of his fingertips where the grinding wheel had worn its pattern over years.

"Sit down," she said.

He did not sit. He stood with his back against the closed door and his hands at his sides and said, "I've done something."

Serena watched him. Her eyes were the color they always were — hazel shading green near the pupil, the kind of color a glassmaker would spend days trying to reproduce and never quite match. She did not ask what.

"Something that can't be undone," he said.

She was quiet. The candle guttered in some draft he couldn't feel and then steadied. On the table, her ledger lay open to a page of figures — credits and debits, the ordinary arithmetic of a glassmaking house. Materials purchased, goods delivered, payments received, payments owed. The economy of fire.

"I know," she said.

He had not expected that. Not the words themselves — she could not know the specifics, the hours he had spent at the grinding wheel introducing flaws so subtle that no one would detect them until the lenses were fitted into the housing and the weapon failed to focus, the light scattering instead of concentrating, the beam diffusing into nothing — but the way she said it. Without surprise. As though she had been waiting for him to say it aloud.

She reached up and unclasped the glass-bead necklace from her throat. Eighteen beads on a silk cord, one for each year of her life, each blown by her father's breath and shaped by her father's hands. She set it down on the open ledger. The beads caught the candlelight and threw it in small colored circles across the columns of figures — amber over the cost of soda ash, cobalt over a delivery of sand from the Ticino, deep red over a sum that represented someone's wages. The colors lay on the numbers like a code she had not written.

"Come here," she said.

He crossed the small room. Two steps. She stood from the chair and the chair scraped back against the stone floor and they were close, her face level with his jaw, her breath warm against his throat. She put her hands on his chest and then moved them down to his hands and held them. Turned them over. Ran her thumb across his palms where the calluses were thickest — the ridges of hardened skin that years of grinding had built, the pads of his fingers worn smooth and then rough and then smooth again in a cycle that followed the work. She knew those hands. She had felt them before, in the storage shed in the cold with the cloak beneath them and the stone floor bruising their knees. She did not know what those hands had done today. She pressed her lips to the center of his right palm, where the dust of the grinding still clung, and he tasted guilt in the back of his own throat like iron.

He kissed her. Not the way he had the first time — not the collision of it, the gracelessness that had left him afterwards feeling he had done everything wrong. This was slower. He knew the shape of her mouth now. He knew that her lower lip was fuller than the upper and that she kissed with her eyes open for the first moment and then closed them. He knew the sound she made — a short exhaled breath through her nose — when his hand came up to the side of her neck. He held her there, his thumb against her jaw, his fingers in the weight of her hair where it was pinned, and he kissed her until the rhythm of it was established, unhurried, a tempo they both understood.

She pulled back and began to undress. Not for him — or not only for him. She undid the laces of her bodice with the efficient hands of a woman who dressed and undressed herself, who had no maid for this, whose fingers were calloused from work that was not needlework. He helped where she let him. The bodice. The linen shift beneath. Her skin in the candlelight was warm and faintly golden with freckles across her shoulders and collarbones, a scattering like the beads on the ledger, like colored light thrown by glass.

He undressed. The yellow circle came away with his shirt — that badge of cloth he unpinned each night and pinned again each morning, the law's reminder stitched to his chest, bright as a coin, the size of a man's palm. It fell to the stone floor with the shirt and lay there, a circle of yellow fabric among the dark folds of linen. If someone had entered the room they would have seen it. But no one entered the room.

She sat back against the table's edge. The ledgers were behind her. He stood between her knees and put his hands on her thighs and felt the muscles there tense and then ease. Her skin was warm. His hands were rough. She reached for him and pulled him closer by the hips, and when their bodies met it was different from the first time — not the shock of unfamiliar skin but the recognition of something already known, a surface his hands had learned.

He entered her slowly, both of them adjusting, her back arching, her hands gripping the table's edge behind her. The ledger shifted. A column of figures slid beneath the glass beads and the beads rolled slightly, clicking against each other, amber touching cobalt, cobalt touching red. He held her hip with one hand and braced the other on the table beside her and found a rhythm — steady, deliberate, the rhythm of someone who had spent his life making small precise adjustments and who brought that patience now to the work of her body. She wrapped her legs around him and her heels pressed into the backs of his thighs and she breathed against his shoulder in short open-mouthed exhalations that he felt as heat on his skin.

They moved together. The table creaked. Her hand came up to the back of his neck and gripped the hair there, not gently, and he pressed his face into the curve where her neck met her shoulder and breathed the smell of her — ink and tallow and beneath that something warmer, something that was only her. His hands on her skin, the grinding calluses dragging slightly, catching on the fine hairs of her arms, her waist, the soft concavity below her ribs. The same hands that had spent the day pressing flawed glass against the wheel, introducing imperfections grain by grain, a patience that required absolute control. He brought that control here. Slow and then slower. Her breath against his ear saying yes and then not saying anything, just breathing, her body tightening around him in increments, and he held the rhythm steady, did not accelerate, let it build in the way he understood building — not force but accretion, not speed but sustained attention.

When she came it was quiet. A contraction he felt through his whole body, her thighs tightening, her hand pulling his hair hard enough to hurt, and a sound low in her throat that was not a word. He held still and let her finish and then moved again, faster now, his own control dissolving in a way that frightened him because it felt like the opposite of what he had spent the day doing — not the careful introduction of flaws but the loss of all precision, all intent, and when he finished it was with his forehead against her collarbone and his breath ragged and his hands shaking where they gripped the table.

They stayed like that. Her fingers loosened in his hair. His breathing slowed. The candle had burned down a quarter inch and the wax had pooled and hardened in a shape like a small island on the dish. She did not move from the table. He did not pull away. The counting room was silent except for the sound of their breathing returning to its ordinary rhythm, the way a furnace settles after the stoking.

After a time he straightened and looked at her. Her hair had come loose from its pins and fell across one shoulder. Her eyes were open and watching him with an expression he could not read — not tenderness exactly, not satisfaction, but something more appraising, more deliberate. The expression of a woman doing arithmetic.

"Something is coming," he said. His voice was rough.

"I know," she said again. The same words, the same tone. As if knowing were the only thing left to do.

He looked at the necklace on the ledger. The beads had shifted during the act — rolled into new positions, their colored shadows now falling on different numbers. Amber on a debt. Red on a sum owed. He reached for the necklace, thinking to give it back to her, to restore something to its place.

"No," she said. "Leave it."

He drew his hand back. She slid from the table and began to dress, retrieving her shift from the floor, lacing her bodice with those same efficient hands. He dressed too. He found his shirt, shook it out, and pinned the yellow circle back to the fabric over his chest. The small bright badge, the law's geometry, returned to its place against his breastbone. She watched him pin it without comment.

When they were clothed again they stood on either side of the table like negotiators. The ledger was still open. The necklace lay across it — eighteen glass beads on a cord, each one a year, each one her father's work. The colors still fell across the figures, those small circles of tinted light turning the page into something other than an account book. She looked at the necklace and then at the numbers beneath it and he saw her face change — not soften, not harden, but resolve, the way a lens resolves an image, everything that had been blurred sharpening into a single clear point. The accounts and the cost. The numbers and the light. What he had done and what she was choosing to know.

She closed the ledger over the necklace. The beads disappeared between the pages, the colors vanished, and the book lay shut on the table like any other book of debts.

"Go," she said. "Before the watch."

He went. The door latched behind him and the night air of Murano was cold on his face and smelled of the lagoon and of furnace smoke and of the faint chemical sweetness of molten glass cooling somewhere nearby. He walked toward the boat landing with his hands in the pockets of his coat. His fingers were still trembling. The glass dust was still in the lines of his palms, mixed now with the salt of her skin, and he could not have said where one residue ended and the other began.
