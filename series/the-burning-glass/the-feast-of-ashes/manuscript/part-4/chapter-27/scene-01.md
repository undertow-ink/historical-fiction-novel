The friar's hands were clean. That was the first thing Enzo noticed — the nails trimmed, the skin scrubbed pink at the knuckles, as though Giordano had prepared for the examination the way a surgeon prepared for a cutting. He had laid out his instruments on a square of white linen: calipers with brass jaws, a jeweler's loupe on a leather cord, three templates cut from sheet brass and etched with curves that corresponded to his optical calculations. The templates were numbered in the friar's tight, angular hand. I, II, III. Latin numerals for Latin certainties.

"We will proceed in order," Giordano said. He did not look at Enzo. "Primary elements first, then secondaries, then the corrective set. You will hand them to me as I call for them."

"Yes, Fra Giordano."

The component room was narrow, windowless, lit by four oil lamps that Enzo had trimmed that morning. The light was steady and warm, pooling on the stone worktable where the lenses waited in their felt-lined trays. Thirty-two elements in all. Enzo had ground and polished every one. He had checked them against Giordano's specifications himself, first with the templates and then with the reflection test — holding each lens so that a candle flame doubled in its surface, reading the symmetry of the twin images for any whisper of distortion. They were clean. They were perfect. He had made sure of that.

Giordano lifted the first primary lens and held it to the lamp. He turned it slowly, watching the light move through the glass. Then he fitted the loupe to his eye and brought the lens close, scanning the surface in a methodical sweep — center first, then outward in a spiral to the beveled edge.

"Batch number?"

"Seventeen," Enzo said. "Signore Bardolino's second melt of November."

"Any inclusions noted during grinding?"

"Two small seeds near the rim. I ground past them. The finished surface is clear."

Giordano set the lens on the first brass template, checking the curvature against the etched line. He pressed gently at three points around the circumference, testing the seat. Enzo heard the faint tick of glass meeting brass. No gaps. The curve was true.

The friar made a mark in his notebook. A small cross — passed. He set the lens aside and held out his hand for the next.

They worked through the primary set in silence. The room smelled of lamp oil and the faint mineral scent of clean glass. Enzo handed each lens across the table with both hands, the way Bardolino had taught him — fingers on the edges only, never the optical surfaces. His grinding calluses rasped against the bevels. He kept his breathing even. There was nothing to hide here. Every lens would pass, because every lens was right.

The sabotage lived elsewhere. In the brass mounts that held the lenses in their housing, in the rotational positions he had set during final calibration. A quarter-degree here, a third of a degree there — offsets so small they fell within the normal tolerance of hand-fitted work, yet large enough, in combination across the full array, to smear the convergence pattern at range. At twenty paces, in a workshop, the array would focus cleanly. The errors canceled at short distance, the geometry forgiving. At two hundred paces, at the ranges the arsenal men needed, the beam would bloom and scatter, the individual deviations compounding along the optical path until the instrument became useless for anything but burning a man's shadow on a wall.

But the mounts were not in this room. The mounts were with the housing, and the housing was at the arsenal, and Viaro had the arsenal.

Giordano finished the primaries and started on the secondaries. His movements had grown quicker, more clipped. The small crosses accumulated in his notebook, a column of passing marks that answered nothing.

"The polishing medium," he said. "What compound?"

"Tin oxide in a tallow base. Signore Bardolino's standard formula."

"And the final grit? You graduated through the sequence I specified?"

"Exactly as specified. Five stages. I keep a log."

"Show me."

Enzo crossed to the shelf where he stored his grinding records. The log was a bound quarto of cheap paper, its pages stiff with dried slurry at the edges. He had kept it faithfully — dates, batch numbers, grit sequences, times, even the temperature of the room on days when the cold thickened the polishing paste. He set it on the table and Giordano paged through it without comment, his eyes tracking down the columns. Everything was in order. Everything was true. Enzo had not needed to lie in this log, because the lie was not in the lenses.

Somewhere beyond the workshop walls, Viaro was conducting his own examination. Enzo did not know the details, but Bardolino had mentioned it that morning — the arsenal commander had ordered a full review. Shipping manifests, material accounts, the housing fabrication records from the metalworkers' shop. The tolerances on every bracket and every mount. Viaro was a methodical man. He would check everything, and he would find nothing wrong, because the mounts sat within their allowed tolerances. Each one, taken alone, was acceptable. It was only the pattern — the deliberate accumulation of small deviations, all pushing the same way — that betrayed intent. And you would only see the pattern if you suspected it. If you were looking not for error but for design.

Viaro was not looking for design. He was looking for incompetence, for bad materials, for a supplier who had cheated on the glass quality or a metalworker who had rushed his fittings. He would find competence at every turn.

Giordano set down the last corrective lens. Twenty-ninth cross in the notebook. He removed his loupe and rubbed the bridge of his nose where the cord had pressed a red line into the skin. The white wool of his sleeves, pushed above his elbows, had collected a fine dust of glass residue that caught the lamplight like frost.

"They are correct," he said. The words came out flat, a verdict that solved nothing. "Every element is within specification. Several are better than specification." He closed the notebook. "Your work is not in question, Enzo."

"Thank you, Fra Giordano."

"Do not thank me. It would be simpler if I had found a flaw." He turned the notebook in his hands as if the answer might be hidden in its binding. "The mathematics are correct. I have verified the calculations three times. The components are correct — I have now verified them with my own hands. The fabrication records, if Viaro's review bears out, will also be correct. And yet the instrument failed."

He stood and moved to the end of the table, where the lamp threw his shadow long and angular against the wall. His tonsured head gleamed.

"There are possibilities I have not yet eliminated. Thermal gradients during the test — the autumn air was bitter, and glass responds to cold. Differential contraction could shift the focal geometry. Or the transport from workshop to arsenal — vibration in the boat, the housing jarred against the gunwale. Alignment is delicate. A thousandth of a degree, compounded across sixteen elements..." He trailed off, his lips moving silently, running numbers in his head.

Enzo said nothing. He arranged the lenses back in their felt-lined trays, primary set on the left, secondaries in the center, corrective elements on the right. His hands were steady. A thousandth of a degree was not what he had introduced, but Giordano was circling the right territory now, sniffing at the edges of the truth without knowing its shape.

"I want the array reassembled," Giordano said. He had reached his decision. "Here, in this workshop. Not at the arsenal. I want to test it at bench range under controlled conditions — stable temperature, no transport, the housing mounted and aligned in place. If it performs correctly here, then the fault is environmental or mechanical, something introduced between calibration and deployment. If it fails here..." He paused. "Then I have missed something fundamental, and I will find it."

"I will prepare the bench," Enzo said. "Tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow. First light. I want the full day."

Giordano gathered his instruments into their linen wrap, folding the cloth over the calipers with the same care a priest folded an altar cloth. He paused at the door.

"Your master speaks highly of your precision, Enzo. He says you have the finest hands on Murano for this work."

"Signore Bardolino is generous."

"Bardolino is not generous. He is accurate." The friar's gaze held for a moment — appraising, not suspicious, but thorough in the way of a man who trusted measurement above all things. Then he turned and was gone, his sandals slapping the stone corridor in a cadence that faded slowly, like a question repeated until it lost its meaning.

Enzo stood alone in the component room. Thirty-two perfect lenses gleamed in their trays. Tomorrow the array would be reassembled, tested at bench range, and it would work. The convergence would be clean, the focal point sharp and searing, because at twenty paces his offsets amounted to almost nothing. Giordano would be satisfied. Viaro would be told. They would conclude that transport or temperature had been the cause, and they would schedule another field test with better precautions.

And then, at deployment range, the array would fail again.

He trimmed the lamps and locked the component room behind him. The key was cold in his hand. Outside, the winter air off the lagoon smelled of salt and char from the furnaces, and somewhere in the dark a boat knocked against a mooring post with a hollow, patient sound, over and over, like something waiting to be let in.
