The cold found the gap between his collar and his neck and worked there like a finger. Enzo pulled his coat tighter and walked faster, the soda ash in the sack across his shoulder shifting with each stride. The boat landing at Fondamente Nove was behind him, the sandolo already pushing off for its next fare, and ahead the calle narrowed between two buildings whose upper stories leaned toward each other like old men sharing a secret. Winter light fell between them in a thin blade that did not warm anything it touched.

He had crossed from Murano in a wind that chopped the lagoon into grey ridges, and the salt was still on his lips, and his hands were still red from gripping the oar handles, and the taste in his mouth was not salt but the residue of something worse. Three days since the test on the island. Three days since the beam had scattered at distance and the oak plank had stood unburned and Fra Giordano had raged against the glass while the glass kept its secret. Three days, and the silence from Viaro was the kind of silence that precedes weather.

He turned north toward Cannaregio. The market stalls along the Strada Nova were thinning for the afternoon, vendors packing unsold fish into salt barrels, a woman sweeping cabbage leaves into the canal with a broom that had lost half its bristles. Enzo walked with his head down and his hands in his coat and the yellow circle on his chest catching what light there was.

"The soda ash from Khalil's stall. A good choice. He does not cut it with chalk the way the others do."

The voice arrived from his left, close, as though its owner had been walking beside him for some time and had only now decided to speak. Enzo turned.

Carlo Rossetti fell into step with him, matching his pace with the ease of a man who had been following at a distance and timing his approach. He wore a heavier cloak than when they had last spoken, dark wool lined with something that might have been marten, and his rosary hung at his belt the way it always did, the beads clicking faintly with each step. His smile was in place. His eyes were not smiling.

"Signore Rossetti."

"Enzo." Rossetti gestured toward the sack on Enzo's shoulder. "Your master's errands take you far in cold weather. I would have thought the furnace kept its own supply through winter."

"It does." Enzo did not slow his pace. "This is a particular grade."

"Ah. Particular." Rossetti repeated the word as though tasting it. He walked with his hands clasped behind his back, his stride longer than Enzo's but deliberately shortened to match. His boots were good leather, well-oiled against the damp, and they made almost no sound on the wet stone. The calluses on his right hand — the ones Enzo had noticed at the Rialto months ago, the ones that sat wrong for a merchant — were hidden inside his gloves. "Particular soda ash for particular glass. The Bardolino furnace has always been known for its precision. It is one of the reasons I sought you out, that first day at Moretto's stall."

They crossed a bridge. Below them the rio was dark and still, the water carrying a film of ice at its edges where it met the stone. A cat sat on the fondamenta on the far side, watching them with the flat patience of something that hunts for a living.

"You did not come to discuss soda ash," Enzo said.

Rossetti's smile changed. It did not disappear — it deepened, the way a crack deepens in glass when you press, not wider but further in. "No," he said. "I did not."

They walked in silence for twenty paces. The calle opened onto a small campo — a well at its center, the vera da pozzo carved with a lion whose face had been worn smooth by hands and weather. A church on the far side, its door closed, its single window dark. No one else in the campo. The wind came across the open space and Enzo felt it in his teeth.

Rossetti stopped at the well. He rested one hand on the carved stone and looked at Enzo with an expression that had set aside its warmth the way a man sets aside a tool he no longer needs.

"There was a test," Rossetti said. "Three days ago. On an island in the lagoon."

Enzo's hands did not move. His breathing did not change. He had spent years learning to hold glass steady while his arms trembled from fatigue, and the skill translated.

"A device was tested," Rossetti continued. He spoke quietly, the Levantine cadence of his Italian giving each word a weight that Venetian speech did not carry. "An optical device of considerable sophistication. Lenses ground from Murano cristallo, housed in a brass assembly of remarkable quality. The device was tested at short range and performed well. At the range intended for deployment, it did not." He paused. "The lenses were exceptional. The housing was exceptional. The design, I am told, was sound. And yet."

He let the two words hang. They sat in the cold air of the campo like the last note of a bell, diminishing but not gone.

"You are well informed," Enzo said, "for a glass merchant from Ragusa."

Rossetti acknowledged this with a tilt of his head, neither confirming nor denying. "I am a man who pays attention to the products I buy. When a furnace that produces exceptional work produces a result that is less than exceptional, I notice." He turned the rosary bead between his gloved fingers. The gesture was automatic, habitual, and Enzo thought for the first time that it might not be a gesture of faith at all but of counting — a man tallying something in his head, the way Serena's fingers moved on her counting beads. "The failure was surprising. Not impossible — complex devices fail for many reasons. But surprising, given what I know of the craftsman who calibrated the array."

The word sat between them. Craftsman. Not apprentice. Not boy. Rossetti knew who had done the calibration work. He knew more than that.

"What do you want?" Enzo said.

Rossetti removed his hand from the well and clasped both hands behind his back again. He looked across the campo at the closed church, at the lion on the vera da pozzo, at the thin winter sky above the roofline.

"I want to help you," he said. "That is the truth, though I understand you have no reason to believe it. What I can offer is this: if things become difficult for you in Venice — and I believe they will become difficult, Enzo, I believe this with some certainty — I have connections and resources that could take you elsewhere. Ragusa. Ancona. Further, if necessary." He turned back to Enzo. "My people have ships. My people have houses in places where Venice's arm does not reach. These things I can guarantee."

"And the price."

"I need to understand the device." Rossetti's voice did not change in volume or pace. He said it the way he might have said he needed to understand the thread count of a particular silk — professionally, without apology. "Its principles. Its construction. The specifications of the lenses and their arrangement. Not to build it — I have no interest in building such a thing. But to understand what it can do. And what it cannot." He held Enzo's gaze. "Surely that is reasonable. A man in my trade needs to know what is being bought and sold, even when the goods are not his own."

The wind crossed the campo. The cat on the far fondamenta had gone. The well stood between them, its stone dark with winter damp, the lion's worn face staring at nothing with the patience of something carved to outlast everything that looked at it.

Enzo thought of his father. Of Giacomo's hands on the grinding wheel, the steady turn and press that had taught Enzo everything he knew. Of the furnace explosion they called an accident — the cracked crucible, the steam, the blast that had taken a man who spent his life knowing exactly how hot to run a melt. Of the questions that had lived in Enzo's chest for three years, unanswered, unanswerable, heavy as unworked glass.

"No," Enzo said.

Rossetti did not flinch. He stood very still, the way a man stands when he has expected the blow and has decided to receive it cleanly.

"I understand the offer," Enzo said. "I understand what you are asking. And no."

"May I ask why?"

The question was courteous, genuine. Rossetti's face held none of the cold calculation that Viaro's held, none of the ecstatic indifference of Fra Giordano. There was something in it that looked like honest curiosity, and beneath that something older and more tired — the expression of a man who had watched too many negotiations end in the wrong place.

"Because I did not break it so that someone else could fix it."

The words came out flat and hard, like a lens set on a table, and Enzo heard in them a finality that surprised him. He had not planned the sentence. It had arrived from somewhere deeper than planning, from the part of him that had sat at his father's workbench and measured curvatures that were designed to fail, that had pressed his thumbs into the grinding wheel night after night introducing flaws so precise they were invisible, that had stood on the island three days ago and watched the beam scatter and felt not triumph but the bleak, clean relief of a man who has broken something that needed breaking.

Rossetti looked at him for a long time. The rosary beads were still between his fingers. His dark eyes held an expression that Enzo could not parse — not anger, not the tactical recalculation he had expected. Something closer to recognition. The look of a man seeing, in another man's stubbornness, the shape of a choice he himself had once faced or might yet face.

"You are your father's son," Rossetti said quietly, and the words were the same words Viaro had used, but where Viaro had meant them as diagnosis, Rossetti meant them as elegy.

He let the rosary drop against his belt. He looked down at his hands, then up at the grey sky, then at Enzo.

"The people I work for will learn what happened on that island," he said. "If they have not learned already. They will study the failure. They will reach conclusions. And the people you work for — the ones who commissioned the device, the ones who paid for the glass and the brass and the island and the secrecy — they too will study the failure, and they too will reach conclusions." He stepped closer to Enzo. Not threatening. The step of a man closing distance so that his words would not need to travel far. "You are standing between two furnaces, Enzo. And neither one knows you are there. When they find you — and they will find you, because men like them always find the flaw — I will not be able to help."

He said it without menace. He said it the way a physician might describe the progression of a disease — not with satisfaction, not with cruelty, but with the steady voice of someone reporting what he has seen before and expects to see again.

Enzo said nothing. There was nothing to say. The man was right, and they both knew it, and the knowing did not change anything, because the choice had already been made — had been made weeks ago on a grinding wheel in a dark workshop, had been made years before that in his father's hands, had perhaps been made the first time a man looked through a lens and understood that what magnifies can also burn.

Rossetti pulled his cloak tighter. He looked at Enzo once more — a last, measuring look, the kind a man gives to a thing he is about to walk away from — and his face held something that was close to sorrow.

"The figs from Smyrna," he said. "They will not be coming this season. The trade routes have grown unreliable." He raised his hand in the same farewell he had given at the Rialto months ago, when the world had been a different shape. "Be well, Enzo Sforno."

He turned and walked across the campo. His boots were quiet on the stone. He did not look back. He passed the church and the closed door and turned into the calle beyond, and the calle took him, and he was gone.

Enzo stood at the well. The soda ash pulled at his shoulder. His breath made small clouds in the cold air, each one forming and dissolving before the next arrived. The campo was empty. The church was dark. The carved lion on the vera da pozzo stared out at nothing with its smooth, worn face, and the winter light lay flat on the stone, and somewhere to the north the furnaces of Murano were smoking, and to the south the offices of the Council of Ten were doing whatever it was they did behind their closed doors, and Enzo stood between them with his coat pulled tight and his hands still and the yellow circle bright on his chest, and he did not move for a long time.

Then he shifted the sack on his shoulder and walked north toward Cannaregio, toward the ghetto, toward home. The cold worked at his collar. The stones were wet beneath his feet. Behind him the campo held its silence, and the well held its water, and the lion held its patience, and the afternoon darkened by a degree, and then by another, and then the light was gone.
