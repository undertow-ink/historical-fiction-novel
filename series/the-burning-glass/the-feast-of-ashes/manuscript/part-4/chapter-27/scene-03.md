The counting room smelled of tallow and cold stone. Enzo found her at the narrow desk beneath the high window, the one that admitted a blade of winter light across the ledgers. She did not look up when he entered, though the latch was loud enough.

"Close the door," she said.

He did. The room was smaller than he remembered — shelves of bound volumes along one wall, a cabinet of drawers for receipts and bills of lading, a single brazier that had burned low. The air held a chill that the coals could not reach.

Serena turned a page. Her quill moved across a column of figures, the nib scratching steadily. She finished the line, set the quill in its rest with the care of someone placing a blade back in its sheath, and looked at him.

"Sit down."

There was no second chair. He leaned against the cabinet.

"Two men came to the furnace yesterday," she said. "Not suppliers. They wore Council livery and carried no samples. They spoke with my father for an hour and examined the stores of antimony and manganese. They weighed the cullet bins." She folded her hands on the open ledger. The knuckles were white, but the hands did not tremble. "The day before that, Tommaso Grassi was questioned at his dock. His boy told our boy. Before that — last week — the provveditore sent a clerk to copy records from three furnaces on the north bank. Ours was not among them. Not yet."

Enzo said nothing. His mouth had gone dry.

"I keep these books," Serena said. "I know what moves through this island — what is bought, what is sold, what is ordered and by whom. The Council has doubled its purchases of borax and refined sand in the last four months, all routed through the Arsenal stores. That is not glassmaking. That is something else. And now they are asking questions about quality and yield, and they are not asking gently." She paused. "So. Who has been questioned besides Grassi?"

"I don't know."

"What do they know?"

"I don't know that either."

"How much time?"

The question hung between them. He had no answer for it. She knew he had no answer. She asked it anyway, the way she would have asked him to confirm a figure she had already calculated — not for information but to see whether he would lie.

"Not long," he said.

Her eyes held his. Hazel-green in the thin light, steady as a spirit level. She had not blinked. He watched her breathe — one slow breath, controlled, the ribs expanding beneath the dark wool of her dress. She was afraid. He could see it in the absolute stillness of her body, the way everything was held in place by will alone, the way a crack in glass holds its shape until you touch it.

"I need to show you something." She drew the ledger closer and turned back through several pages. "Here. These are the Council's supplementary orders for the quarter — I copied them from the posting at the customs house." Her finger traced a column. "Antimony, potash, lead oxide. All in quantities that make no sense for any commission I have seen. And here —" She turned another page, and stopped.

The glass-bead necklace lay across the gutter of the ledger. The cord had settled into the binding, and the beads — eighteen of them, each a different color, each made by her father's hands — caught the window light and threw small bright flecks against the page. Red and amber and a blue so dark it was nearly black. They rested on a column of numbers like a rosary abandoned mid-prayer.

Neither of them spoke. She turned past it without touching the beads, found the page she wanted, and pointed.

"This pattern. Do you see it? The orders increase each month. Whatever they are building, they are still building it. Which means whatever you did —" She did not finish the sentence. She did not need to. The arithmetic was clear. Whatever he had done, it had not been enough, or it had been discovered, or both.

Enzo stared at the figures and saw his mother. Not her face — her silence. The way Mirela had gone to the scuola to pledge against Giacomo's death benefit without telling him. The way she had sold his ring and said nothing until the money was spent. Choosing alone. Protecting by concealing. He had hated it as a boy, the not-knowing, the way she carried danger like a private possession. And here he stood, having done the same thing to the woman watching him across a desk of numbers.

The recognition turned in his gut like a key in a bad lock.

"You should have told me," Serena said. Not loudly. The words were level, precise, delivered with the same deliberate care she used to set down the quill. "Not what you did. I am not asking for that. But how close it has come. You should have told me how close."

"I was trying to —"

"I know what you were trying to do." She cut him off without raising her voice. "You were trying to keep me outside of it. To make the choice alone so I would not have to carry it. My father does the same thing. He tells me the furnace is fine while the crucible lining is cracked to the fire-ring. He thinks he is protecting me. He is making me blind." She leaned forward. "I chose this, Enzo. I chose you. That was not an accident and it was not ignorance. Do not make it ignorance after the fact."

The brazier shifted. A coal broke and settled, sending a brief flare of heat across the floor.

"I am not going to weep," she said, "and I am not going to ask you to run. But if the net is closing, I will not be the last to know. I have a right to the arithmetic." She touched the ledger — not the necklace, the page beside it, the column of numbers that told the story she had already read. "I can count, and I can plan, and I can be of use. Or you can protect me into a darkness where I cannot help you and cannot help myself. Those are the choices. Not yours. Mine."

She held his gaze. The beads glinted between the pages, catching the last of the winter light, each one a year of her life set down in glass by hands that had tried to give her something that would not break.

Enzo opened his mouth and closed it. There was nothing to say that she had not already said better, and with less waste.

"Tell me," she said. "Start from the beginning. And do not leave anything out."

He pulled the cabinet's edge against his back, felt the wood through his shirt, and told her.
