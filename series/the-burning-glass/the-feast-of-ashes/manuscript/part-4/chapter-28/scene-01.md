The bench stood where it always stood, against the north wall of Bardolino's workshop, beneath the row of windows that gave the cleanest light. Enzo had helped Fra Giordano position the housing there the previous evening, lifting the brass cylinder onto its cradle while the friar guided the wheeled mount across the uneven flagstones. Now, in the thin February morning, Giordano was already at work — sleeves of his white habit pushed above his elbows, fingers moving through the lens positions with the reverence of a man handling communion wafers.

Enzo ground a concave blank at his station and did not watch. He did not need to. He had assembled thirty-one of the thirty-two mounts himself, and he knew what Giordano would find at bench range. He knew it the way he knew the grit of Murano dust between his molars, or the particular ache in the meat of his right thumb where the grinding wheel pressed hardest. At twenty paces, the offsets did not matter. The geometry was forgiving at close quarters. Light, like rumor, only scattered across distance.

"Enzo." Giordano's voice carried the tight brightness of a man about to be proven right. "Come hold the target board."

He set down his blank, wiped his hands on his apron, and crossed the workshop. Bardolino was already there, standing to one side with his arms folded and his weight shifted off his bad right knee. The old master's face had the guarded neutrality Enzo had learned to read over three years of apprenticeship — the expression Bardolino wore when he did not want anyone to know what he was thinking.

Enzo took the target board — a square of pale beechwood, half a braccio on each side — and held it at arm's length at the end of the bench. Twenty paces from the housing's mouth. Giordano had already opened the workshop's east-facing shutters, and a blade of winter sunlight fell across the array at the angle he had calculated. Enzo could see the light enter the first rank of lenses, pass through the second, refract through the third. The brass housing caught the glow and held it.

"Steady," Giordano said. He adjusted the rear mount by a fraction, sighting along the central axis. Then he stepped back.

The beam hit the target board as a single bright point, no wider than Enzo's thumbnail. He felt the heat on his knuckles. After six seconds, a thin curl of smoke rose from the wood's surface, and the sweet smell of scorching beech filled the space between them.

Giordano exhaled — a sound so full of vindication it was nearly a laugh. "There. You see? There is nothing wrong with this instrument."

He said it to the room, to Bardolino, to the lenses themselves. He said it with the absolute certainty of a man whose mathematics had been questioned and who could now point to a burning mark on a board and say: the numbers do not lie. Enzo set the target down. The scorch mark was a tight black circle, edges clean. Exactly what it should be. Exactly what he had known it would be.

"The autumn test," Giordano said, pacing now, his sandals slapping the flagstones. "Thermal gradients. The lagoon air in late autumn — the differential between water temperature and air temperature creates refractive distortion across long distances. I should have accounted for it. And the transport — we carried the housing in an open boat across two miles of chop. Every wave a perturbation." He turned to Bardolino. "We will test again. February air is cold but stable. We use a cushioned barge — wool packing, a covered frame. No exposure to spray. And we test on a still day, early morning, before the sun heats the ground and the thermals begin."

Bardolino nodded. "I will arrange the barge."

"Good. Good." Giordano was smiling. He picked up the target board and examined the scorch mark again, holding it close to his face, turning it in the light. A scholar admiring his own proof. "The theory is sound. The lenses are sound. The failure was procedural, not fundamental."

Enzo returned to his grinding station. He picked up the concave blank and resumed his work, and the familiar vibration of glass against stone moved up through his wrists and into the bones of his forearms. He let the rhythm settle him. The bench test had gone as he had calculated — the same calculation he had run when he introduced the offsets, working the geometry in charcoal on a scrap of parchment he had burned afterward. Twenty paces: convergence within acceptable limits. Two hundred paces: cumulative angular error sufficient to smear the focal point across an area wider than a man's body. The beam would spread, the energy would dissipate, and the wood would not burn. The weapon would fail every time it was deployed at range, and every time it was tested at bench, it would succeed. A contradiction that looked like nature and not like hands.

Giordano's explanation — thermal gradients, transport vibration — was elegant and plausible and wrong. But it was the kind of wrong that a brilliant man could sustain for months, because it fit the available evidence and because it flattered his understanding of optics. Enzo had counted on this. He had counted on the primacy of the lenses in Giordano's thinking — that a mathematician would examine the glass before the brass, the way a poet would examine the words before the meter.

The morning passed. Giordano packed the housing for transport back to the arsenal, wrapping each section in oiled cloth with the tenderness of a father swaddling an infant. Bardolino helped him carry the pieces to the handcart outside the workshop door. Enzo stayed at his station and ground the blank down to its final curvature, checking his work against the iron template every few passes. The calluses on his fingers — thick ridges of dead skin across the pads of his index and middle fingers, a permanent roughness no amount of oil could soften — caught on the glass edge as he turned it.

It was past midday when Bardolino came back in alone. He stood at the doorway for a moment, silhouetted against the gray light of the yard, and Enzo could see the set of his shoulders — drawn up and tight, the posture of a man carrying something he did not want to carry.

"There has been a second examination," Bardolino said. He crossed to Enzo's station and stood close, his voice lowered to the register he used when creditors came to the workshop door. "Viaro brought in a man from the arsenal. Not an optics man. An engineer — someone who fits cannon breeches and knows how metal seats against metal."

Enzo kept his hands on the blank. The grinding wheel turned. "When?"

"Three days ago. Before Giordano's bench test. The man examined the housing mounts. Not the lenses — the mounts."

The glass vibrated against the stone. Enzo adjusted his pressure, a fraction less on the left edge, and the vibration evened out. His hands knew this work well enough that his mind could move freely behind them, and what moved there now was not panic but arithmetic. An arsenal engineer. A man who understood tolerances not as theory but as practice — who knew, from fitting bronze to bronze in gun housings, what a deliberate pattern looked like inside the noise of hand-fitted work.

"What did he find?" Enzo asked.

"I don't know." Bardolino's hand went to his apron pocket — the familiar gesture, his fingers finding the millefiori paperweight he kept there, closing around it. "Viaro did not tell me what the man reported. He told me only that he had ordered the examination. A second opinion on the mount positions — those were his words."

Enzo said nothing. He turned the blank against the wheel and listened to the pitch of the glass change as the curvature deepened. A second opinion on the mount positions. The mounts he had aligned. The mounts where his sabotage lived — not in any single offset that could be called an error, but in the systematic bias of all offsets together, the pattern that only emerged when you measured every mount and plotted the deviations and saw that they all leaned the same way, like trees bent by a prevailing wind.

Any one mount, examined alone, was within tolerance. An arsenal engineer would not stop at one mount.

"Bardolino," Enzo said. "Did Viaro say anything about me?"

The old man's fingers tightened around the millefiori piece. "No. He said nothing about anyone." He paused. "But he asked who had done the alignment work. I told him. I had no reason not to tell him — it is your work, and it is good work. I have always said so."

Enzo nodded. He set the blank down and cleaned his hands with a rag, working the grit out of the creases of his knuckles, the lines of his palms. Through the workshop's south window he could see a corner of the furnace yard — the brick wall, the stack of beechwood billets, the iron grate where they cooled the punty rods.

Movement in the yard. Not the heavy shuffle of the furnace workers or the quick steps of an apprentice on an errand. A different kind of motion — unhurried, precise, the walk of a man who arrived at places rather than hurried to them.

Viaro stepped into the frame of the window. He wore a dark silk doublet, close-fitted, and the gold ring on his right hand caught the low winter light as he adjusted his glove. He had not been announced. No message, no servant sent ahead. He was simply there, the way a change in weather was there — present before you noticed, settled before you could prepare.

He stood in the yard and looked at the workshop. Not at the door. At the window — at Enzo, who stood behind it with the cleaning rag still in his hands and the yellow circle on his doublet and the grinding dust in his hair. The distance between them was perhaps fifteen paces, close enough to see the scar along Viaro's jaw, the line of it pale against his shaved skin.

Viaro did not speak. He did not gesture or beckon or smile. He looked at Enzo with the focused attention of a man reading a document he had already read before — not searching for meaning but confirming what he had already found. It was the look of completion. Of a question answered and an answer weighed and a decision not yet made but approaching, the way a boat approaches a dock — slowly, deliberately, with the gap between them closing at a rate that could be measured but not stopped.

Enzo held the look. He had his father's eyes — dark, steady, the eyes Giacomo Sforno had carried into the furnace every morning for twenty years until the morning the furnace took him. He held Viaro's gaze and understood what it contained. Not accusation. Not yet. Something prior to accusation and more dangerous: certainty.

Viaro knew.

The question now was not whether the sabotage had been found. The question was what Viaro intended to do with a Jewish lens-grinder who had crippled a weapon of the Venetian state — and the answer to that question was not written anywhere Enzo could read it. It lived behind that quiet face, in the space between the gold ring and the jaw scar and the particular stillness of a man who served the Council of Ten and who never, in Enzo's experience, raised his voice. Because men who could destroy you quietly had no need to be loud.

Bardolino had come to the window. Enzo felt the old man beside him, felt the intake of breath, the recognition. Bardolino's hand found Enzo's shoulder — the left hand, the one missing the tip of the ring finger, lost to a shearing blade thirty years ago. The grip was firm and frightened and told Enzo nothing he did not already know.

In the yard, Viaro pulled his glove smooth over his fingers, turned, and walked toward the workshop door.
