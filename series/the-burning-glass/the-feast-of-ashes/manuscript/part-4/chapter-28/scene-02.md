The door opened without sound. Enzo had oiled the hinges himself three weeks ago, a small vanity of maintenance in a room full of precision instruments, and now the silence of Viaro's entrance felt like something he had built for the man.

He was sorting quartz blanks at the far bench. Counting them, in truth, though he had counted them twice already and would not have been able to say how many there were. His hands needed occupation. Through the workshop's thin walls he had heard the voices — Viaro's quiet tenor among them, asking after him with the unhurried courtesy of a man who already knew exactly where to look.

The component room was narrow and deep, cut into the building's interior wall where no window could reach. Three oil lamps burned on their iron brackets, their flames upright and still in the dead air. Felt-lined trays covered the main workbench in two rows of eight, and in each tray a lens sat in its cradle — thirty-two finished optics, ground and polished to tolerances that most glassmakers on the island would have called impossible. The light caught their edges and held.

Viaro closed the door behind him. The latch seated with a click that sounded, in that small room, like a word.

"Enzo."

"Signore Viaro."

Viaro stood with his back to the door. He did not lean against it. He held no papers, carried no instruments. His hands rested at his sides, the gold ring on his right hand catching lamplight. The ambergris reached Enzo a moment later — that careful, expensive smell that preceded Viaro into every room like an announcement.

"You know why I am here."

It was not a question, but Enzo answered it. "Yes."

Viaro moved to the workbench. He looked at the lenses in their trays the way he looked at everything — with an attention so complete it seemed to leave nothing for the rest of the world. He lifted one lens, turned it in the light, set it back in its felt cradle.

"The optics are extraordinary," he said. "Bardolino's best work. Perhaps the best work this island has produced in a generation. Every surface true. Every curvature within specification. I had an arsenal engineer examine them independently, and he used the word *flawless*. He does not use that word."

Enzo said nothing.

"The housings are equally fine. The brass is clean. The bore dimensions are precise. The threading is excellent." Viaro touched the edge of a tray with one finger, aligned it a fraction with its neighbor. "But you know this. You made most of it."

"I helped make it."

"You set the final calibration positions. The rotational alignment of each mount in its housing. Twenty-eight mounts. Twenty-eight calibration settings." Viaro looked at him. His eyes were the color of walnut heartwood in the lamplight, and they did not blink. "Each one within tolerance. Each one, taken alone, acceptable. A master calibrator might have questioned two or three, but taken alone — acceptable."

Enzo felt the edge of the workbench pressing against his lower back. He had not realized he was leaning against it.

"But taken together." Viaro paused. Not for effect — Viaro never paused for effect. He paused because he was selecting words with the same precision Enzo used to select grit for grinding paste. "Taken together, every rotational offset biases in the same direction. Every one. The probability of that occurring through random error in twenty-eight independent calibrations is —" He stopped. "But you know the mathematics better than I do."

"I know the mathematics."

"Yes. You are very good at mathematics." Viaro said this the way a physician might note a patient's strong constitution before delivering the diagnosis. "Each offset within tolerance. The pattern invisible unless you looked for it. Unless you measured every mount against every other and mapped the aggregate deflection." He moved along the bench, his fingers trailing above the trays without touching them. "Elegant work."

The compliment settled in the room like frost.

"I have been considering," Viaro said, "how a young man arrives at such a decision. An eighteen-year-old apprentice. Jewish. Dependent on the good will of the Republic for his residency, his livelihood, his mother's safety in Cannaregio." He said *Jewish* without inflection, the way he might have said *left-handed* — a fact relevant to the calculation, nothing more. "A young man in that position who decides, quietly, over weeks of careful work, to introduce a systematic flaw into a weapon commissioned by the Council of Ten. That is not impulse. That is conviction."

Enzo's throat was dry. He did not swallow.

"You are your father's son."

The words hit him below the sternum. Not because they were cruel — because they were exact. Rossetti had said the same words less than a week ago, had said them with grief and something like admiration, as recognition of what it cost to choose rightly when every choice was ruin. In Rossetti's mouth the phrase had been a hand on his shoulder.

In Viaro's mouth it was a file, opened on a desk.

Viaro knew. About Giacomo. About the furnace. About the explosion that the Guild of Glaziers had attributed to a cracked crucible and that Mirela had never believed and that Enzo had spent four years learning to understand. Viaro knew, or suspected enough that the distinction did not matter, and he spoke the knowledge now with the calm of a man laying a card on the table — not the highest card, not yet, but high enough to show the shape of his hand.

"Your father was also clever," Viaro said. "Also careful. Also, I think, certain that he was doing the right thing." He let the silence hold for a moment. It was not the silence of threat. It was the silence a mourner leaves between the name and the prayer. "You see where his certainty brought him."

"I see where it brought him."

"And you persist."

"Yes."

Viaro studied him. The scar on his left jaw, that thin white line from ear to chin, caught the lamplight when he turned his head. A knife wound, Enzo had always assumed. Old. Almost invisible unless you knew to look. Like a calibration bias mapped across twenty-eight mounts.

"There is a simple resolution," Viaro said. "You recalibrate the mounts. Correctly, this time. You set the alignment true, and the weapon functions as designed. Your name is cleared. No one else is informed. The matter remains between us, in this room." He gestured, a small movement, taking in the lamps, the trays, the close walls. "The Council need never know."

"And if I do not."

"Then the Council will be informed that their weapon has been sabotaged by its own calibrator, and the Council has methods for addressing sabotage that would make a furnace explosion seem —" He paused again. Selected. "— brief."

Enzo looked at the lenses. Thirty-two of them, perfect, useless without the housings that would direct their gathered light. He thought of the weapon deployed at range against a ship's hull. The beam striking timber and pitch and sailcloth. The fire starting where no fire should start, at a distance from which the men who lit it would never hear the screaming. That was what the weapon was for. Fire at a distance, in the hands of men who would never smell the flesh.

"No," Enzo said.

"No."

"I cannot recalibrate the weapon."

"Cannot, or will not."

"Both. I cannot put fire in other men's hands. I will not."

He heard his own voice as if from the far end of the room — steady, quiet, and belonging to someone braver than he was. His hands were shaking. He pressed them flat against the bench and held them there.

Viaro did not move. For a long moment he stood at the end of the workbench, his right hand resting near the last tray, the gold ring dull against the dark felt. The oil lamps burned. The air smelled of brass filings and ambergris and the faint mineral breath of polished glass.

Then something changed in Viaro's face. Not softness. Enzo had seen Viaro's version of softness, and it was indistinguishable from his version of everything else. This was different. A recalculation, perhaps. Or a recognition — the kind of recognition that a man whose profession is the leveraging of human weakness experiences when he encounters a specimen that will not lever. Viaro's brother had died in the Ottoman wars — had burned on a galley, if the rumors were true. Perhaps Viaro saw that burning in Enzo's refusal. Perhaps he saw his brother's face in the conviction of a boy who would not build the instrument that made such burning possible from a safe distance.

Or perhaps it was nothing. Perhaps Viaro was simply calculating logistics — schedules, reports, the efficient processing of a saboteur.

"Three days," Viaro said.

Enzo looked at him.

"I will give you three days. Use them wisely."

He opened the door. The hinges made no sound. He left it ajar behind him, and Enzo listened to his footsteps recede through the workshop — measured, unhurried, the steps of a man who had never once in his life needed to run.

Enzo stood in the component room. Thirty-two lenses in their felt-lined trays. The key to the room in his right hand, though he could not remember taking it from the hook. Three days.

He understood what the three days were. Not mercy. Viaro did not trade in mercy. A final accounting — time enough to run, or to reconsider, or to set one's affairs in order. Time enough to get Mirela out of Cannaregio if he was fast and if Rossetti would help and if the weather held for a crossing. Three days was a door left open by a man who had no obligation to leave it so.

And that was the worst of it. That was the thing that settled in his chest as the lamplight steadied and the workshop fell silent around him. Viaro had given him grace. Viaro, who dealt in leverage and consequence, who spoke of the Council's methods the way other men spoke of weather — as inevitabilities one dressed for — had looked at an eighteen-year-old Jewish apprentice who had just refused to save his own life, and had given him three days.

Because Viaro had seen him. Not as a saboteur, not as a name in a report, not as a problem to be processed. As a person. As a man's son, standing where his father had stood, making the choice his father had made.

A man who sees you as a person before he destroys you is worse than a man who never sees you at all. Because the man who never sees you is only doing his work. But the man who sees you and destroys you anyway carries the knowledge of what he has done, and that knowledge is the only coin in which such men are ever paid, and it is not enough, and it changes nothing, and Enzo would be just as dead.

He closed his hand around the key. The brass was warm from his grip. The lenses watched him from their trays, thirty-two perfect circles, thirty-two small moons.

Three days.

He blew out the first lamp. Then the second. The third he carried with him to the door, and locked the room behind him, and walked out into the February dark where the furnace light from Bardolino's glory hole threw long shadows across the canal path and the air tasted of salt and sulfur and the last cold nights before a Murano spring that he might not be alive to see.
