Frost on the workshop windows had drawn its own diagrams overnight — branching patterns that looked, in the early light, like the vein maps of leaves pressed between the pages of a book no one would read. Bardolino stood before the grinding bench with his leather apron already tied and his hands already aching from the cold and from something else, something deeper than cold, that had settled into the bones of his fingers during the night and had not left with the morning.

He had not slept. He had lain in the dark of his upper quarters and listened to the furnace breathe below him, the low exhalation of banked coals that never fully stopped, that sound which had been the pulse of his life for fifty years, and he had waited for it to comfort him the way it always had, and it had not. Through the floorboards he felt the heat — faint, residual, the memory of yesterday's fire — and he thought of Enzo walking into the February dark last night with Viaro's footsteps still echoing in the yard, and he thought of the look on the boy's face when he came out of the workshop, and he thought of the hand he had placed on Enzo's shoulder, the left hand, the one with the missing fingertip, and how the boy's shoulder had been rigid beneath it.

He had not asked what Viaro said. Enzo had not offered. The boy had walked to the canal path and untied his sandolo and rowed into the dark without looking back, and Bardolino had stood in the yard and watched the boat become a shadow and then a sound and then nothing, and then he had gone inside and climbed the stairs and sat on the edge of his bed with his boots still on and the millefiori piece turning in his fingers, turning and turning, the colored flowers catching the last furnace light through the gap in the shutters.

Now it was morning. The workshops of Murano were stirring — he could hear the Contarini furnace across the canal, the scrape of iron doors, a man's voice calling for wood. His own furnace men would arrive within the hour. Tomaso was already below, banking the overnight coals, and through the floor Bardolino heard his son's boots on the flagstones and the particular clang of the ash rake against brick that meant Tomaso was working with the distracted aggression he brought to every task when something was wrong.

Everyone knew something was wrong. You could not have Marcantonio Viaro arrive unannounced at a glassmaker's workshop and leave again forty minutes later without the entire island taking note, the way the water takes note of a stone — not by examining it, but by rearranging itself around the disturbance.

A knock at the workshop door. Not the furnace door, which was never locked and never knocked. The workshop door, the one that opened onto the canal path, the one with the new brass lock that Caterina had asked about months ago and that Bardolino had answered too sharply. He knew the knock. Two measured strikes, unhurried, the knock of a man who did not need to be let in because he could as easily arrange for the door to open itself.

Bardolino crossed the workshop. His right knee protested on the cold flagstones, and he adjusted his stride the way he had learned to do over the years — not a limp, exactly, but a redistribution of weight that anyone who watched carefully would recognize as pain accommodated rather than pain overcome. He opened the door.

Viaro wore the same dark silk doublet, buttoned to the throat. His gloves were calfskin, pale, new. The ambergris preceded him through the doorway like a herald announcing a prince who preferred not to be named, and his eyes — dark, precise, recording everything they touched — moved across the workshop the way a customs officer's eyes move across a cargo hold: without haste, without curiosity, assessing only what is present against what should be.

"Maestro Bardolino." The voice was warm. Viaro's voice was always warm when what he carried was cold. "I apologize for the early hour."

"Signore Viaro." Bardolino stepped aside. His hand went to his apron pocket, and his fingers closed around the millefiori piece before he could stop them. "I did not expect you this morning."

"No. But I think you expected me soon." Viaro entered and stood in the center of the workshop, between the grinding stations and the annealing shelves, and he removed his gloves one finger at a time and laid them across his left palm. The gold ring on his right hand caught the thin window light. The scar along his jaw, that fine white seam from ear to chin, was sharpened by the February cold into something that looked less like an old wound and more like a score mark on glass — the kind of line a craftsman cuts before he snaps a piece in two.

Bardolino closed the door. The latch seated, and the sound was too loud in the room, and he wished he had oiled it, the way Enzo oiled things, with that quiet attention to the details that served him rather than the details that served others.

"You spoke with the boy last night," Bardolino said. Not a question. He would not pretend not to know that much.

"I did." Viaro moved to the grinding bench — Enzo's station, the one nearest the window where the light was truest. He ran a gloved finger along the iron frame of the grinding wheel. "He is talented, your apprentice. You have taught him well."

"He was talented before I taught him anything. His father —"

"Yes. His father." Viaro lifted his hand from the wheel and examined his glove, as if checking for dust, though there was none. Enzo kept his station immaculate. "Maestro Bardolino, I will tell you what I have learned, and I will tell it plainly, because you deserve that courtesy. You have served this project with skill and with loyalty, and I have never questioned either."

The courtesy was worse than accusation. Bardolino recognized the pattern — the compliment laid down like a cloth before the blade — because he had seen Viaro deploy it with others, with the arsenal officials, with Fra Giordano, with the men who came and went from this project like figures in a processional whose destination none of them had chosen. He had watched Viaro praise a man's competence and then explain, with the patience of a physician describing a terminal illness, why that competence had not been sufficient.

"After the autumn test," Viaro said, "I commissioned a second examination of the device. Not the lenses. Fra Giordano has examined the lenses and found them without fault. Not the mirrors. Not the alignment calculations. The housing mounts." He paused, and the pause was precise, a measured silence, the silence of a man who understands that what is not said between two statements can change the meaning of both. "I brought in an arsenal engineer. A man who fits cannon breeches, who understands how metal seats against metal. A practical man. I asked him to examine all twenty-eight rotational mounts and report on their alignment."

Bardolino's hand tightened on the millefiori piece. The glass flowers pressed into his palm, and the pain was small and familiar and useless.

"He found," Viaro said, "that every mount is within tolerance. Each one, examined individually, would pass inspection. Your apprentice's work is — as you have always told me — excellent." He turned from the grinding bench and faced Bardolino, and his expression held the same composed attentiveness he might bring to a ledger column that did not sum correctly. "But every rotational offset biases in the same direction. Every one. Twenty-eight independent calibrations, and every deviation falls on the same side of true."

The words entered Bardolino the way heat enters glass — not all at once but from the outside in, the surface comprehending before the core, the meaning arriving at his hands and his stomach before it reached his mind. He understood what Viaro was saying. He understood it with the part of him that had spent forty years reading the truth in materials — the part that could tell, by the sound of a tapped vessel, whether the glass had cooled evenly or whether a stress line lived inside it, invisible, waiting for the vibration that would make it crack.

"The probability of such a pattern occurring through random error," Viaro continued, "is not a number worth speaking. An arsenal engineer does not need to be an optician to recognize a systematic bias. At bench range — twenty braccia, the distance at which Fra Giordano ran his test — the offsets are too small to matter. The geometry forgives them. The beam converges." He folded his gloves once, twice, with the care of a man folding a letter he has decided to send. "At deployment range, they compound. The beam spreads. The weapon fails."

Bardolino sat down. He did not choose to sit down — his knee chose for him, or something in his chest chose, some mechanism of the body that understood before the mind did that a man cannot remain standing when the floor beneath him is no longer solid. He sat on the low stool beside the grinding bench, and the stool creaked, and he put his hands on his thighs and pressed them flat because pressing them flat was the only way to keep them from shaking.

"The calibrator," Viaro said, "was Enzo Sforno."

He said the name the way he said everything — evenly, without inflection, with the careful neutrality of a man who has learned that emotion is a form of leverage and who prefers to keep his leverage in his own hands. But something moved behind his eyes as he spoke it. Not sympathy. Viaro did not trade in sympathy. Recognition, perhaps. The acknowledgment that the name he was speaking belonged to a person rather than a problem, and that the distinction, while it changed nothing about what must happen next, was worth the fraction of silence he allowed after speaking it.

Bardolino looked at his hands. The scars from forty years of furnace work — the pale webs of old burns on his forearms, the thickened skin across his knuckles, the absent fingertip on the left hand that he had stopped mourning decades ago — these were the hands that had taught Enzo to grind. These hands had guided the boy's grip on his first lens blank, had corrected his pressure, had shown him how to feel the grain of the glass through the spinning stone and read the surface by touch when the eye could no longer distinguish between true and almost-true. Every skill the boy possessed, Bardolino had placed there. Every technique, every instinct, every refinement of craft that separated precision from approximation — these were Bardolino's gifts, given freely, given with pride, given with the particular generosity of a master who sees his own best qualities reflected in a student and mistakes the reflection for continuation.

And the boy had turned every gift against the weapon that Bardolino had built.

The thought was a fissure line running through the center of a finished piece, the kind of crack that does not show on the surface but lives inside the structure, invisible until the glass is struck and the whole thing falls apart along a seam you should have seen when the material was still hot. He should have seen it. He should have known. The autumn test, the failure at range — Giordano had blamed thermal gradients, transport vibration, the inconsistency of lagoon air, and Bardolino had accepted every explanation because every explanation was better than the one he had not allowed himself to consider.

The boy who cleaned his grinding station with monastic care. The boy who could calculate focal lengths in his head faster than Fra Giordano could write them on paper. The boy who had watched the weapon burn a plank at twenty braccia and had stood at the water's edge with his hands at his sides and his face closed and still, showing nothing — not because he felt nothing, but because what he felt was already finished, already resolved, already acted upon in twenty-eight calibration settings that fell, every one, on the same side of true.

"Elegant work," Viaro said. "That was the engineer's word. Not mine. He said the sabotage was the most elegant work he had seen in twenty years of fitting precision instruments. Each offset invisible alone. The pattern visible only in aggregate." He moved to the window and looked out at the canal, where the morning light was beginning to burn through the February haze. "Your apprentice has extraordinary hands, Maestro Bardolino. You should be proud."

The cruelty of it — if it was cruelty, and Bardolino was no longer certain that Viaro intended cruelty any more than a blade intends to cut — was that he was proud. That was the thing that sat in his chest like a coal that would not go out. The boy's work was extraordinary. The sabotage was, in its way, the finest calibration work Enzo had ever done — finer than the Morosini lenses, finer than anything Bardolino himself could have achieved, because it required not only precision but its opposite, a controlled imprecision so subtle that it mimicked nature. Random error drifts. Systematic bias holds a direction. To make systematic bias look like drift — to introduce it gradually, consistently, across twenty-eight independent settings, and to calculate the exact magnitude that would cancel at close range and compound at distance — this was mastery. This was the culmination of everything Bardolino had taught him.

And it was what Bardolino should have done.

The thought arrived, and he did not turn from it. He could not turn from it, because it was not a crack in a finished piece that could be set aside. It was the truth of the piece itself, the truth that had been there since the beginning, since the morning he agreed to Viaro's commission and told himself that the weapon would never work, that glass was not diamond, that theory and practice were separated by a distance no friar's mathematics could bridge. He had told himself these things, and they had been lies, and he had known they were lies, and he had told them anyway, because telling them allowed him to keep grinding and keep fitting and keep collecting Viaro's gold and keep the furnace burning and keep the Bardolino name alive for one more season, one more year, one more commission after this one.

The boy had seen what Bardolino would not see. The fire did not care whether the man who built the housing believed it would work. The fire burned regardless of the builder's intentions, and complicity was not lessened by the comfortable fiction that the thing you helped create would fail. Enzo had understood this. Enzo, who was eighteen years old and Jewish and dependent on the good will of every Christian on this island for his survival, had looked at the weapon and seen it clearly and done what clarity demanded. And Bardolino, who was fifty-seven and Christian and a master of his guild, who had the freedom and the standing and the power to refuse — Bardolino had ground the lenses and built the housing and checked every mount twice and then a third time and told himself it was only glass.

"I spoke with him last night," Viaro said. He had not turned from the window. His profile against the morning light was precise — the jaw scar, the straight nose, the close-trimmed hair above the collar of the silk doublet. "I offered him the opportunity to recalibrate. Correctly. No report. No consequences. The matter would have remained between us."

"And he refused."

"He refused." Viaro turned from the window. "You know the boy. You are not surprised."

Bardolino was not surprised. That was another coal, another small heat that would not go out. He had raised the boy for four years. He knew the set of that jaw, the way the dark eyes went flat and still when Enzo had decided something, the particular silence that preceded not weakness but resolution. Giacomo had been the same. Giacomo Sforno, who had ground lenses for this same project years before Enzo ever touched a blank, who had introduced his own careful flaws into his own careful work, and who had died in a furnace explosion that the guild called an accident and that Bardolino had never examined too closely because examining it would have required him to see what he was standing in.

He rubbed the missing fingertip against his thumb. The phantom sensation was there, as it always was — the ghost of a digit lost to shears thirty years ago, the nerve endings still firing their small alarms into the space where the finger used to be, the body remembering what the mind had agreed to forget.

"I have given him three days," Viaro said. He pulled his gloves on, one finger at a time, the reverse of the gesture with which he had removed them. "You should know that. Three days in which to reconsider, or to arrange his affairs, or to do whatever a young man does when the ground shifts beneath him." He smoothed the calfskin over his knuckles. "I tell you this because you are his master, and because I believe you deserve the courtesy of knowing."

Courtesy. The word sat in the room like a cup placed on a table by a host who has already poisoned it.

"And after three days," Bardolino said.

"After three days, I will make my report to the Council." Viaro picked up nothing, adjusted nothing, touched nothing further. He simply moved toward the door with the unhurried precision of a man for whom departure and arrival were the same act seen from different ends. At the door he paused — not for effect, Viaro did not pause for effect, he paused because he was arranging the next words with the same care Bardolino used to arrange lens blanks in a firing tray.

"The boy did what he believed was right," Viaro said. "I have no quarrel with his conviction. My quarrel is with its consequences." The latch lifted under his hand. "Think about that, Maestro. Think about what conviction costs, and who pays."

The door opened. The canal air came in, carrying salt and the low-tide smell of exposed mud and the distant clang of another furnace's morning preparations. Viaro stepped through. He did not look back. The door closed behind him with the soft click of a mechanism perfectly fitted, and Bardolino sat on the stool beside Enzo's grinding bench and listened to the footsteps recede along the canal path until there were no footsteps, only the furnace breathing below him and the frost melting on the windows and the millefiori piece in his hand, warm from his grip, the colored flowers blurred now because his eyes were wet and he was too old and too proud to call it what it was.

The workshop was empty. Enzo's grinding wheel stood still, the stone dark with yesterday's slurry, the iron frame catching the morning light in a line along its upper edge. A concave blank sat in the holding clamp — half-finished, abandoned mid-curve, the kind of piece Enzo would never have left unless he expected not to return.

Bardolino looked at the blank. He looked at the wheel. He looked at the bench where his own hands had guided the boy's hands, season after season, teaching pressure and angle and patience and the particular listening that a grinder must do with his fingertips, hearing the glass speak through the stone. He had taught the boy everything. Everything the boy used to cripple the weapon. Everything the boy used to do what Bardolino should have done.

A cracked pot leaks before it breaks. His father's words. But Bardolino had not cracked. That was the thing. He had held his shape. He had maintained his form through every firing, every cooling, every inspection — held it perfectly, beautifully, the way a master's work should hold. And inside that perfect form, where no one could see, the glass was hollow. The glass had always been hollow. And the boy had known.

He sat in the empty workshop and held the millefiori piece and did not move. The frost on the windows was melting, and the patterns it had drawn — those branching lines that looked like diagrams, like the maps of cracks in cooling glass, like the paths that water takes when it follows gravity rather than intention — were disappearing, running down the panes in thin streams that caught the light and threw it, briefly, across the floor in shapes that meant nothing and looked like everything and were gone before he could name them.
