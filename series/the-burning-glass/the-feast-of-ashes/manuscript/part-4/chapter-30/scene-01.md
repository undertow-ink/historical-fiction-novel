The oar found the water and the water gave.

Enzo pulled. The sandolo slid forward across the lagoon's black surface, and the wake opened behind him in a line he could not see, and the furnace smoke of Murano fell back by a hand's width, then another, then another. He did not look behind. He had tied the boat at the quay in the dark, working the knot by touch — two wraps, a half hitch, a tug — the knot Bardolino had taught him four years ago when his hands were smaller and his fingers had not yet learned the particular roughness of wet rope on grinding calluses. Then he had untied it. The line slipping free was the softest sound he had heard all day.

Forward, pull, recover. The rhythm entered his arms the way a pitch enters tuned glass, settling into the resonance the body knows without instruction. His shoulders burned. Not from effort — he had rowed this crossing a thousand times. The burning was older, lodged beneath the skin of his upper back, a tension that no amount of motion could discharge.

March air. The cold was cleaner than February's — sharper, thinner, carrying less of the mineral dampness that thickened winter nights over the lagoon. He breathed it and tasted salt and the faint sulphur of Murano at his back and, underneath both, the emptiness of open water, which had no taste at all. The sky was clear. Stars spread above him in arrangements he had never learned the names for, because his father had not taught him stars and Bardolino had not taught him stars and Gritti had offered once and he had said no, he had enough to learn. The stars were adequate without names. They held their positions and gave what light they could and did not require his understanding to persist.

The oar dipped. Black water parted around the blade.

Rossetti's warning had come through a boy — a child of nine or ten who appeared at the Sforno door at the second hour of the night with a scrap of paper folded twice. The words were simple: the figs will not keep. Enzo had read them standing in the doorway with the canal dark behind the child's head, and the child had waited for no reply, had turned and vanished into the calle the way canal water vanishes into stone. The figs will not keep. The trade routes have grown unreliable. Rossetti's farewell weeks ago, spoken with the particular care of a man arranging words to carry weight they would not bear at first hearing. The Council had been informed. Viaro's three days had produced their report, and the report had produced whatever mechanisms such reports produced — warrants, perhaps, or something quieter than warrants, something that moved through the Republic's channels the way water moved through the lagoon, finding its level, filling every space.

He rowed. His hands on the oar were steady, and the steadiness was not courage but practice — the body's loyalty to the work it had been trained to do regardless of what the mind carried.

Bardolino had confirmed it. Not to Enzo — to Viaro, in the workshop, in words Enzo had not heard but could reconstruct the way a grinder reconstructs a curve from its fragments. The boy acted alone. He knew this because the furnace still stood. The Bardolino name had not been struck from the guild register. Tomaso still worked the firebox each morning, and the chimney still smoked. If Bardolino had taken the blame, the furnace would be dark. The furnace was not dark. The logic required no intuition. It required only the willingness to see what the evidence showed.

His father.

The oar paused at the top of its arc. Water dripped from the blade in the dark — three drops, four, each one a small sound swallowed by the larger silence. Enzo held the stroke and let the sandolo glide. Ahead, Venice was a low smear of light on the horizon. Behind him Murano's glow had diminished to an orange thumbprint, no brighter than a coal held at arm's length.

He was between.

Giacomo Sforno had died in a furnace explosion three years and four months ago. The Guild of Glaziers had attributed the blast to a cracked crucible — a failure of material, an accident. Enzo had believed this. He had been fourteen and his father was ash and the explanation was simple and grief preferred simple things, the way damaged glass preferred dark rooms where no light could find the fracture.

He had believed it through the apprenticeship, through the storeroom discovery, through the Alhazen manuscript and the stolen lens, through the confrontation with Bardolino. Through all of it, a part of him had held to the simpler reading: that Giacomo had tried and failed. That the sabotage — brave, principled, doomed — had been discovered, and the discoverers had killed him, and the killing had accomplished nothing because the weapon was rebuilt and the project continued as though Giacomo Sforno had never laid his careful hands on a single blank. A brave man's futile gesture.

The reading had been bearable because it was complete. A failed act requires only grief. It does not require you to decide what the act meant.

He pulled the oar through the water. Venice grew. Its lights separated as distance resolved them into individual sources — this lantern, that window, this reflection on water, each one a thing in itself rather than part of a general glow.

A lens resolves the same way.

Giacomo had not failed.

The thought had been forming for weeks — since the beam scattered at range and Fra Giordano cursed the thermal gradients while Enzo's sabotage held its silence inside the brass housings. Since Viaro's words in the component room: *you are your father's son.* Since Bardolino's choice. The thought had been assembling the way an optical array assembles — element by element, each one adding its fraction of convergence, together focusing toward a point of clarity that the mind approaches the way the eye approaches a bright light: slowly, with resistance, knowing that what waits at the center will burn.

His father had seen the weapon. Not as theory. Not as diagrams on a friar's slate board. Giacomo had seen it the way a grinder sees a flaw — through his hands, through the material, through the specific physical knowledge of what this glass would do when light entered it at this angle and passed through at this curvature. He had held the lenses and understood what the assembled device would become.

And he had acted. Not from half-measures. Giacomo had been a Jewish lens-grinder on Murano, dependent on Christian patronage for his livelihood, dependent on the Guild for his right to work, dependent on the Republic for his family's permission to exist. He had held less power than any man in the conspiracy. Less than Bardolino, who had the furnace. Less than Viaro, who had the Council. Giacomo had held nothing but his hands and his knowledge of what those hands were making, and he had used both — the skill to introduce flaws, the knowledge to calculate which flaws would matter — in an act so precise that it was itself the highest expression of his craft.

The sabotage was not a failure of strategy. It was the truest thing Giacomo ever ground.

Enzo's arms burned. He rowed. The stars turned overhead, and somewhere a night bird called from the barene flats to the north, a single sound that carried across the lagoon the way light carries across a lens — diminishing with distance but never fully gone.

To grind a lens is to decide what will be seen clearly. You choose the curvature. You choose the focal length. You remove material — grain by grain, pass by pass — until the surface left behind is the surface you intended. Not the surface the glass wanted to be. Not the surface that required the least effort. The true surface.

Every lesson Bardolino had given him, every correction of pressure, every instruction to feel the grain through the stone and trust his fingertips when his eyes could not help — every one had been double. A lesson in craft and a lesson in seeing. To grind precisely is to attend precisely. To attend precisely is to see what is there rather than what is convenient. Giacomo had known this. Had taught it to his son at the workbench in Cannaregio, where the tools still sat in their places and the dust gathered and Mirela swept around them but never moved them, because the arrangement was a language and the language still meant something, even if the man who spoke it was gone.

The craft that built the weapon was the same craft that broke it. The grinding wheel did not distinguish between construction and sabotage. It turned. The grinder chose.

And Enzo had made the same choice. Twenty-eight mounts. Twenty-eight calibration settings, each one offset by a fraction, together sufficient to scatter a beam that was designed to burn men alive on ships they could not leave. He had done it with the same hands, the same calluses, the same knowledge — the inheritance passed from father to son not in words or wills or property but in the specific, physical, unrepeatable education of fingers on glass.

It might kill him. The way it had killed Giacomo — a furnace explosion that the Guild called accident, a cracked crucible, a burst of steam and fire that took a man who knew how to read a melt and should have been nowhere near a compromised vessel. The coincidence had never been credible. It had only been convenient.

The oar dipped. Venice was closer now. He could make out the shapes of buildings along the Fondamente Nove, the dark bulk of the timber yards, the lower line of Cannaregio beyond.

He knew what the other path looked like. Bardolino's path. To keep the furnace. To keep the name. To stand in the workshop with the millefiori piece turning between your fingers and the knowledge turning with it — the knowledge that you had seen clearly once, when you were young and the glass was honest, and had spent thirty years learning not to see. Alive. Skilled. Hollow. The fire does not judge what it melts. Bardolino had said this, and believed it, and the believing had eaten him from the inside out.

That was not acceptable. Not the dying — the hollowing. His father had refused it. Had chosen the furnace over the emptying, the three years of posthumous silence over a life in which his hands produced work his conscience could not hold.

Enzo did not pretend this made the dying welcome. His arms hurt. His chest ached from the cold and from something deeper than cold. He was eighteen and his father was dead and his master had betrayed him and the Republic whose laws governed the yellow circle on his doublet was hunting him for the crime of breaking a thing that should never have been built. But the dying was acceptable. The way a grinding loss is acceptable — the material removed to reach the true surface. You do not mourn the grit. You measure the surface that remains and you check it against the template, and if the curve is true then the loss was not loss but work.

His father's curve had been true. Enzo's was the same curve, ground to the same specification, with the same cost.

The sandolo's hull scraped against something — a piece of driftwood, a waterlogged stake from a rotted channel marker. The jolt passed through the flat bottom and into his knees, and he adjusted his stance without thinking. The wood bumped along the hull and fell behind, and the oar caught the next stroke, and he was past it.

Venice rose. Cannaregio. The low waterfront, the timber yards, the dyers' poles with their cloth taken in for the night, the stone quay where he would step ashore and become what he had always been — a Jewish lens-grinder's son, wearing the circle, walking the narrows, going home.

Three more pulls. The quay was close enough that he could hear the water lapping against its stones, the small persistent sound of a thousand arrivals. He shipped the oar and let the sandolo carry its own momentum into the shallows. The hull touched stone. He reached for the mooring post and felt the familiar rough surface beneath his fingers, the iron ring, the cold that metal held at night.

He tied the boat. Two wraps, a half hitch, a tug. The same knot. His hands made it in the dark without error.

Above the quay, the calle led north into Cannaregio. Beyond the narrows, beyond the locked gate that would not open until morning, the Sforno house waited — Mirela's lamp, and the workbench against the wall with its tools arranged in their places, untouched, patient, holding the shape of the hands that had last used them.

He stepped onto the quay. The stone was solid beneath his feet. The yellow circle on his doublet caught the lamplight from a window above and held it for a moment — a small bright point, no wider than a thumbnail, the size of a focused beam on a target board — and then he turned into the calle and the light let him go, and his footsteps moved north through the dark, steady, unhurried, the steps of a man who knew where he was going because he had finally seen, with the clarity that only comes after the grinding is done and the surface is true, that the place he was going was the place he had always been.
