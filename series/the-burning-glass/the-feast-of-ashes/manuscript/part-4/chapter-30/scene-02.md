Salt on his lips when he licked them. The taste of the crossing still in his mouth, the lagoon still on his hands where the oar had soaked them. The fondamenta was dark. He tied the sandolo to the mooring post by feel, his fingers finding the iron ring the way they always found it, and climbed the slick stone steps to the calle.

Cannaregio at this hour belonged to cats and to the canal. The water moved against the foundations with its patient sound, that endless lapping, and somewhere above him a shutter creaked in a draft that carried the smell of wet plaster and the timber yards to the east. No lamps. The moon had gone behind cloud during the crossing and had not come back.

He walked. The calle narrowed and turned and he followed it without thought, his body knowing the route the way his hands knew the grinding wheel — by repetition, by years. Past the blocked well. Past the low doorway of the synagogue, closed and dark, the stone lintel carved with grape clusters that he had traced with his fingertip as a child and that were smooth now from a century of other children's hands.

The door of the Sforno house was not locked. It never was. Mirela kept a latch, not a bolt; she had told him once that a locked door kept out friends and did not keep out enemies, and the distinction was the only one worth making. He pressed the latch and went in.

Dark. The brazier had burned to ash. The smell of the house rose around him, rosemary from the ceiling beams, cold ash, the lye soap his mother used on her hands and on strangers' linen, and beneath it all the smell that never left: linseed oil, brass filings, ground glass. His father's smell. The smell of work done in this room by hands that were gone.

He stood inside the door and breathed it.

Three years. The smell had not faded. It lived in the wood the way colour lives in glass, not on the surface but in the structure, part of the material itself.

His eyes adjusted. Shapes separated from the dark. The table, the two stools, the brazier on its iron stand. On the shelf the kiddush cup sat with its dull silver catching nothing. The curtain to the sleeping chamber hung drawn closed, and behind it the sound of his mother's breathing, slow and even.

She had waited for him. He knew this the way he knew a lens curvature by touch. She would have sat at the table with a candle and her mending, that particular stillness she brought to waiting — not patience but endurance, the posture of a woman who had learned that the people she loved left through doors and sometimes did not come back through them. The candle would have guttered. She would have gone to bed, because sleep was a discipline she enforced the way she enforced everything: by deciding it was necessary.

The trunk stood by the wall beneath the window. He had not noticed it before he left. Now he saw it. The leather straps buckled, the lid closed, the brass corners dull in the dark. She had packed it. Days ago, perhaps. Before he knew there was anything to pack for. She had read the season the way a fisherman reads the sky, and she had acted, and she had said nothing, because saying something would have required him to choose before he was ready.

Her ring was gone from her hand. He had noticed it last week and had not asked. The gold band Giacomo had given her, worn on the fourth finger of her right hand in the Ashkenazi way. She had sold it. For the trunk, for passage, for whatever a woman with red hands and no husband could buy with a dead man's gold to keep her son alive.

He understood her now. Not as a son understands a mother, that understanding was old, the understanding of a child who sees only what is given and not what it costs. He understood her as a person who had made choices alone, in the dark, with insufficient power, and who had chosen correctly because she saw what was needed and did not look away.

She had done what Giacomo had done. Used the tools she had.

Enzo crossed the room. His shin found the stool and he did not sit on it. He moved past it, past the table, to the wall where the workbench stood.

Dust covered it. Three years of dust, undisturbed. Not the fine pale film he remembered from those first weeks but heavier, greyer, a sediment of seasons laid down like the silt the lagoon deposits on its banks. No one had touched it. His mother swept the rest of the house every morning, the broom moving in its efficient arcs across the floorboards, and every morning the broom stopped at the edge of the workbench's shadow and did not cross. The dust was not neglect. It was intention.

He put his hands on the bench.

The wood was cold. Scored and stained, the surface a map of twenty years of Giacomo's work: burn marks from hot punty rods, pale arcs worn smooth where his forearms had pressed while grinding. Enzo's fingers found the arcs. His own forearms fitted the grooves more closely than they had at fifteen. Not perfectly. His father's arms had been thicker, and the grooves held the memory of that thickness the way a mould holds the memory of the object it was made to cast.

Tools everywhere. Grinding forms, half a dozen, their concave surfaces still carrying chalk marks in Giacomo's hand. Radius notations, numbers that referred to lenses that no longer existed. The calipers, brass, the hinge still stiff. He had opened them once, years ago, in this room, and measured a lens he had taken from the workshop, and the measurement had begun everything. The calipers were closed now. The last distance they had held was his father's last distance, and no one had reset them.

A lens blank sat in the holding clamp at the bench's far end. Unfinished. The surface rough on one side where the grinding had stopped mid-pass, the stone's track visible in a shallow arc across the glass. Giacomo had been working this blank on the morning of the explosion. He had left the house before dawn. Enzo remembered the sound of the door, the creak of the third step. He had gone to the furnace on Murano and had not come back, and the blank had sat in its clamp since that morning, the arc of the stone's pass preserved in the glass like a word interrupted mid-syllable.

Enzo touched it. The glass was cold and faintly rough under his calluses. The same ridges on his fingertips that Giacomo had carried, built from the same work, the same wheels, the same pressure of glass against stone. He ran his thumb across the unfinished surface and felt the grain of it — past rough, not yet fine, the surface holding light without releasing it.

His father had not failed.

The thought was not new. It had come to him on the water, in the dark, between oar strokes. But on the water it had been motion — a current shifting beneath the hull. Here, with his hands on this bench, the thought was still. It was material. It had the weight and temperature of the wood under his palms.

Giacomo had seen the weapon. Had understood what it was, what it would do. And he had done what a craftsman does when the work is wrong: he had corrected it. Not by walking away, not by speaking out, not by appealing to men who would not hear the appeal. He had used his hands. The same hands that ground lenses, that knew the difference between true and almost-true by touch alone. He had introduced his own careful imprecision, the way Enzo had — the same method, the same invisible art of making a thing fail at the exact distance where failure mattered.

The workbench had taught him this. Not in words. In wood. In the tools and their arrangement, in the calipers set to their last measurement, in the chalk marks and burn scars and the worn grooves where a man's arms had rested while doing the most precise work his hands could do. Not a memorial. It had never been a memorial. It was the record of a practice: grinding, measuring, seeing. And the practice was the inheritance, and the inheritance was not skill alone but the principle beneath the skill: that a craftsman's hands answer to the craftsman. Not to the patron or the commission. Not to the furnace or the guild or the Council or any power that could threaten or reward. The hands were his. What they made was his. And if what they were asked to make was wrong, the hands had the right, the obligation, to refuse. Or to correct, quietly, with the precision that only the craftsman possessed.

His palms were grey with dust. His father's dust. He turned his hands over and looked at them. The calluses, the grinding ridges, the lines of glass and stone worked into the whorls of his fingerprints over four years at the Bardolino furnace. His hands looked like Giacomo's hands. Not because memory was that precise, but because the work had shaped them the same way. What he saw when he looked at his own palms was not resemblance but continuation.

He did not sit at the bench. He did not pick up the calipers or the grinding forms or the unfinished blank. The bench was not his to claim. It belonged to the man who had worked there and to the silence that had followed, and the silence was not emptiness but presence — a choice made and a cost paid and a truth held in the grain of the wood the way light is held in glass, invisible until you know how to look.

Behind the curtain, Mirela turned in her sleep. The bedframe creaked once. Then quiet.

He removed his doublet. Folded it the way he always folded it — the yellow circle hidden inside the cloth, against itself — and set it on the chest by the window. The cloth was salt-stiff from the crossing. The circle was just thread and dye, stitched to wool, and tonight it was only that. Cloth on a chest. A thing he could put down.

Through the shutters he could see the first thinning of the dark above the rooftops. Not light yet, not colour, just the subtraction of black from black, the sky separating itself from the buildings the way a lens separates one kind of seeing from another. Dawn was close.

He went back to the workbench. Stood before it. His hands at his sides, his father's dust still on his palms.

The light, when it came, would come through the east-facing window. It would cross the room the way it crossed every morning, low and thin, touching the table, the kiddush cup, the curtain's edge, and eventually it would reach the workbench. The tools, the chalk marks, the calipers, the unfinished blank in its clamp. It would fall on the dust and make it visible, each mote a bright thing suspended in the air above the scored wood. And it would not distinguish between what was present and what was gone. It would illuminate all of it — the bench and the man who had worked there and the son who stood before it now with the same dust on his hands.

Light did not judge. It arrived, and what it touched was seen.

He waited for it.
