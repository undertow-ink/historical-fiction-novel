Three days without the wheel, and his hands had begun to itch.

Not the itch of a rash or a burn but the deeper kind, the kind that lived in the tendons, in the muscles of the forearm that had spent four years pulling glass across stone. He rubbed his right thumb across his left fingertips and felt the ridges there, the calluses still sharp, still carrying the grain of the grinding surface in their whorls.

Rabbi Yehudah came at the morning hour, before the gate opened.

He did not sit. That was the first wrong thing. The rabbi always sat -- the way he prayed, the way he read, the way he told a story. This morning he stood in the doorway with his dark cap low and his hands folded around a leather satchel, and the satchel was the second wrong thing, because Rabbi Yehudah carried books, not bags.

"Walk with me," he said.

Mirela was at the table. Her eyes moved from the rabbi to Enzo and back. She said nothing. The spoon continued its circuit of the pot. But her left hand, the one not holding the spoon, pressed flat against her thigh, fingers spread, the gesture she made when steadying herself against a thing she had already measured and found heavy.

Enzo pulled his doublet from the chest. The yellow circle faced outward when he shrugged into it, the rotella gialla centered on his chest. Thread and dye on wool. He had worn it every day since his thirteenth year and had stopped seeing it the way a grinder stops seeing the dust on his own hands. Today he saw it. A lamp in a dark room, legible at thirty paces.

They descended the stairs. The calle was narrow, the plaster walls close enough to touch with both hands outstretched, water stains climbing to the height of a man's waist. Rabbi Yehudah walked slowly, the bad knee hitching at each step. He did not speak until they reached the fondamenta where the canal widened and the sound of the water covered their voices.

"A boatman came to the synagogue last night," he said. "After the gate closed. He came by water and threw a stone wrapped in cloth at the scuola window. Inside the cloth was a paper."

He opened the satchel and took out a folded sheet. Thin, unmarked, the kind of paper sold in bundles at the Rialto stalls -- anonymous, impossible to trace.

"Read it inside. Not here."

Enzo took the paper. Warm from the satchel, from the old man's body. He put it inside his doublet, against his chest.

"There is more." Rabbi Yehudah stopped walking. They stood at the junction of the fondamenta and a narrow sottoportego that tunneled beneath a building. The passage was dark even at this hour.

"The boatman was not from Murano. His boat had no guild marks. He spoke Venetian but with a Levantine rhythm -- the vowels were wrong. I notice these things." A pause. "I have noticed them for sixty years."

Rossetti. The name surfaced with the clarity of a flaw revealed in a ground lens -- present all along, invisible until the angle of light changed. Carlo Rossetti, the Levantine merchant whose calluses came from something other than silk. Enzo had spoken with him twice, perhaps three times, in settings arranged by others, and each time the conversation had been brief, oblique, a thing said sideways.

"The boatman said one word," Rabbi Yehudah said. "He said: *patience*."

A gondola passed, the gondolier standing at the stern, his body swaying with the stroke. The wake slapped the fondamenta stones.

"I do not know this merchant," the rabbi said. "I do not wish to know him. What I know is that someone with resources has taken an interest in your situation, and that interest may save you or destroy you, and there is no way for me to tell which."

He touched Enzo's arm. Brief, dry, an old man's fingers on wool. Then he turned and walked back the way they had come, the left knee hitching, the satchel empty now.

Enzo stood at the mouth of the sottoportego and did not move.

The paper pressed his ribs. A stone thrown at a window in the dark. A boatman with the wrong vowels. A single word: *patience*.

He entered the sottoportego. Darkness for six steps, seven, the ceiling low enough that he ducked, the walls damp stone that smelled of the canal beneath and the mortar between the bricks and something older, the lagoon's own mineral body pressed into the foundations. Light at the other end. A smaller fondamenta, an arched bridge whose steps had been worn into shallow bowls by centuries of feet, and then a small campo where a well stood capped and a cat slept on the lid in the thin sun.

The map of this quarter lived in his legs the way he carried the memory of a grinding surface in his hands. Every turning, every sottoportego, every campo. Cannaregio was not large. The canal to the south, the lagoon to the north, the gates locked from sundown to sunrise. A quarter within a city, a city within a lagoon, a lagoon within a sea. Nesting enclosures, each one smaller than the last, and at the centre a man with a yellow circle on his chest who had chosen to remain inside them.

In the campo he stopped and unfolded the paper.

The handwriting was careful. Not the hurried script of a man working in the dark, not the formal Latin of a guild document. Italian, merchant's hand, the letters even and controlled. Two lines:

*The figs from Ragusa have been delayed. The ship is expected before Easter.*

No figs. No ship. The sentences were a frame built to hold a different cargo, and the cargo was simple: something was happening, and the happening had a timeline, and the timeline ended before Easter.

Three weeks. Perhaps four. March was already winding down, the days lengthening, the light lasting later on the water.

The paper went back inside his doublet. On the wellhead the cat opened one eye, regarded him, closed it.

The campo was empty. But emptiness in Venice was not absence. Sound carried through the space between stone and water. A voice on a canal reached the fondamenta. A footstep in a sottoportego reached the campo at its end. Anything that moved through this city -- a man, a word, a rumour -- propagated until it was heard by someone who mattered.

The arrest warrant would propagate.

He did not know its shape yet. Whether it was a public document nailed to a board at the Rialto or a quiet instruction passed from the Council to its agents -- the sbirri, the night patrols, the network of informants that Viaro had once described with the calm precision of a man explaining a machine he had built. Some warrants were spectacles. Others were silent: a word to the right officer, a man collected from his bed at three in the morning and taken to the pozzi beneath the Ducal Palace where the water seeped through the walls and the only sound was the canal above.

What he knew was the yellow circle. It drew eyes. It sorted him from the crowd the way a sieve sorts grain, by size, by kind, by the category the law had assigned before he was born. In the quarter he was one circle among many. Outside the quarter he was singular. The constables did not need a description. The circle was the description.

He walked. Through the campo, down a calle so narrow his shoulders brushed both walls, across a bridge where the stone railing had broken and been replaced with a warped plank. Below, the canal was shallow, the water green, the bottom visible -- mud, broken brick, a child's shoe swollen with water. Things fell into the canals and stayed.

On the far side the calle opened to the Canale di Cannaregio, broad and grey, with the morning traffic beginning -- a barge loaded with vegetables, a sandolo carrying two women in dark shawls, a patrol boat.

The patrol boat was long and narrow, rowed by four men, with a fifth standing at the prow. The standing man wore a red cap -- half the boatmen in Venice wore red caps -- but the oars moved with the coordinated pull of men who rowed together daily, and the fifth man stood with his hands at his sides and his eyes on the fondamenta.

Enzo stopped. He was four paces from the water's edge. The yellow circle was visible.

The patrol boat moved past. The standing man's gaze swept the fondamenta -- even, continuous. His eyes passed over Enzo. Passed over the yellow circle. Continued on.

The oars rose and fell. The wake spread in a widening V. The boat turned the corner and was gone.

Enzo breathed.

Not relief. The boat would return. Another boat would come. The yellow circle would be there each time, steady as a signal fire, and the question was not whether the eyes would find him but when.

He turned from the water. The calle walls closed around him. The sky was a strip above, pale blue, thin as a sheet of cristallo held to the light. His shadow moved ahead of him on the stones, and the shadow wore no circle.

At the Sforno house, Mirela was at the table. She had set out bread and a cup of water. The workbench stood against the wall, Giacomo's dust still on its surface, the unfinished blank in its clamp, the calipers closed. The glass-bead necklace lay where he had placed it three nights ago, among the tools, its colours dim in the room's interior light.

He sat. The bread was yesterday's, hard at the crust. He ate it.

Through the window the canal murmured. A boatman called to another boatman, the words lost in the distance, the voice carrying only its shape: human, ordinary, belonging to a morning like any other morning in a city that conducted its cruelties with the same calm it brought to its commerce.

The paper pressed against his chest. *The ship is expected before Easter.*

Rossetti's network -- whatever it was, Levantine contacts, intermediaries, boatmen with the wrong vowels -- was a mechanism Enzo could feel but could not see, the way a grinder feels vibration in the wheel before the flaw becomes visible in the glass. Something was being aligned. He was not the agent. He was the material -- the lens through which someone else's light would pass.

Or the paper was a fiction, the patience a false comfort, and the arrest would come in the night, quiet and efficient, and the yellow circle would be folded inside his doublet on the chest by the window.

The bread was gone. He waited.

Morning light crossed the room. It touched the table, the kiddush cup, the workbench. The familiar passage. It reached the necklace and the beads woke -- amber, cobalt, green, red -- each colour pulling its fraction of the spectrum from the white light, a small thing given and not yet taken.

His hands lay flat on the table. Still a grinder's hands. Still carrying the ridges the wheel had cut into them. Hands without work, without a furnace. Hands that had chosen to stay.

Outside, the gates of the quarter had opened at dawn and would close at dusk. Between the opening and the closing, the patrol boats would pass, and the yellow circles would move through the calles and across the bridges and along the fondamente, visible, counted, known. And somewhere beyond, a ship that was not a ship was making its way toward a harbour that was not a harbour, and figs that were not figs were ripening on a schedule that someone other than Enzo had set.

He waited. The light moved. The canal spoke.
