The fig arrived on a Tuesday.

A boy brought it — not the same boy as before, or perhaps the same boy grown taller in the weeks since Enzo had last seen him, the face narrower, the wrists showing beneath sleeves that had fit in winter. He stood on the landing outside the Sforno house with one hand cupped around the fruit and the other hand empty, and when Mirela opened the door he held the fig out the way a child holds a coin he has been told not to spend.

"For the grinder," he said.

Mirela took it. The boy was gone before she turned back into the room, his footsteps quick on the stairs, the lower door banging, the calle's echo swallowing him whole.

She set the fig on the table. It sat between the bread and the water jug, ripe, the skin split along one seam where the flesh had swelled past what the skin could hold. Dark purple. The smell of it reached Enzo from across the room — sweet, almost fermented, the smell of a thing at the exact moment between ripe and ruined.

The figs will not keep. Rossetti's words. Rossetti's code, established months ago at the Rialto over a transaction Enzo had thought was about glass and that had been about everything else. The figs will not keep had meant *go*. A fig delivered to the door, ripe and whole and given freely, meant something different. It meant the figs had kept after all.

He picked it up. The fruit was warm from the boy's hand. He turned it once, feeling the weight, the give of the flesh beneath the skin, and set it down.

Mirela watched him from the brazier. She did not ask. Three weeks of silence had built its own architecture in this room — not the silence of secrets but the silence of a house in which the people knew what they knew and did not need to say it aloud. She stirred the pot. The ladle moved through whatever thin broth she had made from whatever she had been able to buy with whatever remained of the ring's gold and the mending money and the small, fierce economy of a woman keeping two people alive in a city that had ceased to notice whether they lived or died.

An hour later, Rabbi Yehudah came.

He knocked his four knocks. Mirela opened the door. He entered and sat on the stool by the table the way he always sat, with the careful distribution of weight that his left knee required, and he placed his hands on his thighs and looked at Enzo and said nothing for a long time.

Then he said, "The matter is finished."

Enzo was standing at the window. April light fell into the room at a low angle, catching the dust that Mirela's broom had raised from the floor, each mote turning gold as it drifted through the beam and dark again as it passed beyond. He did not turn.

"Which matter."

"The matter of the warrant. The matter of the weapon. The matter of all of it." Rabbi Yehudah spoke the way he read Torah — with the patience of a man who understood that the words required time to arrive, and that rushing them was a form of disrespect. "I was visited this morning by a member of the community who has contacts among the Arsenal clerks. The programme has been dissolved. The commission cancelled. The components are to be destroyed or dispersed — I do not know which, and it does not matter which, because the order comes from the Ten, and what the Ten dissolve does not reconstitute."

Enzo turned from the window. The rabbi's face held the same expression it always held when delivering news that mattered: composed, attentive, his dark eyes steady beneath the white brows. The expression of a man who had learned long ago that the bearer of news must not add his own weather to the message.

"The warrant," Enzo said.

"The warrant is not rescinded." Rabbi Yehudah raised one hand, a small motion, palm forward, forestalling the question that would have followed. "The Council does not rescind. You know this. The warrant exists. It will continue to exist in whatever archive holds such things. But the clerk my contact spoke with said — and I will give you his words, because the words of clerks are the only scripture the Republic reads — he said the matter has been deprioritized. The resources allocated to its pursuit have been redirected."

"Deprioritized."

"A clerk's word for a clerk's mercy. It means they will not look for you. Not today. Not, I think, tomorrow. Beyond tomorrow I cannot say, because no man can say what the Ten will want next week, and anyone who claims otherwise is either a fool or a member of the Ten, and I have met both and cannot always tell the difference."

Mirela set the ladle down. The sound was small, metal against wood, but it entered the quiet of the room the way a stone enters a still canal — a single disturbance, and then the ripples, moving outward. She stood with her back to them, her shoulders straight, her hands on the edge of the brazier's iron stand. She did not speak. Her shoulders said what her mouth did not: that she had been carrying this for weeks, and the setting down of it was not relief but the particular exhaustion that comes after you stop carrying a thing, when the body registers what the carrying cost.

"Why," Enzo said.

Rabbi Yehudah looked at him. "Why is the programme dissolved, or why are you no longer pursued?"

"Both."

"The same reason, I think. The weapon violated a treaty. The existing agreements between the Republic and the Sultan contain provisions regarding naval armament — what may be built, what may not, what constitutes an act of preparation for a war that neither side has declared. The weapon was built in secret because it could not have been built in the open without breaking those agreements. Someone brought this to the attention of the Ten. Not as a moral argument. As a diplomatic one."

The fig on the table. The warm weight of it in his palm. Rossetti's network, Rossetti's contacts, Rossetti's quiet commerce with men who moved between empires carrying information the way merchants carried silk — folded, concealed, valuable precisely because it crossed borders that goods could not.

Rossetti had done this.

Not from conviction. Not because burning ships was wrong, not because Giacomo Sforno had died for his refusal to build the thing, not because an eighteen-year-old Jewish apprentice had ground twenty-eight deliberate flaws into brass housings and stood in a lamplit room and said *no* to a man who could have had him drowned. Rossetti had done this for his own reasons — reasons Enzo could not fully see, reasons that lived inside the merchant's easy smile and his too-precise questions about glass and his contacts that reached into places no Levantine trader should have been able to reach. Whatever those reasons were, they had arrived at the same destination as Enzo's conscience, and the arriving had nothing to do with conscience at all.

The weapon was dead. Not because it was wrong. Because it was inconvenient.

Enzo sat down at the table. The stool was hard beneath him and the table's edge pressed against his forearms in the worn grooves that held no memory of his own body, only his father's. The fig sat between the bread and the water jug, splitting along its seam. He looked at it.

Rabbi Yehudah waited. He was good at waiting. Sixty years of study had taught him that understanding was not a thing you seized but a thing that arrived, and that the host's only duty was to keep the room ready.

"My father died to stop the weapon," Enzo said. "The weapon stopped because of a treaty."

The rabbi said nothing.

"I sabotaged the lenses. The weapon stopped because of a treaty."

"Yes."

"The right thing. For the wrong reason."

Rabbi Yehudah leaned forward. His hands, spotted with age, the knuckles swollen, rested on the table's scored surface. "There is a midrash," he said. "You have heard me say this before and you will hear me say it again, because I am old and the midrash is what I have. A man plants a tree beside the road. He plants it for shade, because the sun troubles him. Years pass. Travelers rest beneath the tree. A family builds a house beside it. Children climb its branches. A scholar sits beneath it and writes a commentary that changes how a generation reads the law." He paused. "The man planted the tree for shade. The shade was not wrong. But the tree became more than the shade, and the man could not have known, and it does not matter that he could not have known, because the tree grew anyway."

"Rossetti is not planting trees."

"No. Rossetti is planting whatever Rossetti plants, and his reasons are his own, and they are probably not righteous, and they do not need to be." The rabbi's voice was quiet. Firm. The voice of a man who had spent his life inside the gap between what ought to be and what was, and who had learned to live there without pretending the gap was smaller than it was. "Your reasons are yours. They are intact. No one has taken them from you, Enzo. The Council did not act from your reasons. This does not mean your reasons were wrong. It means the world is not a grinding wheel that produces only the surface you intended."

Mirela turned from the brazier. She carried two cups of broth. She set one before the rabbi, one before Enzo. She did not pour one for herself. She stood at the table's end with her red hands at her sides and her face composed and dry, the face of a woman who had weathered worse than this and who measured every storm not by its fury but by what remained standing after it passed.

"Eat," she said to the rabbi. "You walked here in the cold."

"It is April, Mirela."

"April is cold."

He drank. The broth was thin, onion and bone, the same broth she had made every morning since the ring's gold started running out. Enzo drank his. The clay cup was warm against his palms, the grinding calluses catching on the glaze. Through the open window the sounds of Cannaregio entered: a woman calling to a child, the slap of laundry against stone, a cart's wheels on the calle, the canal's persistent murmur beneath it all. April sounds. The quarter's life continuing in its ordinary cadence, indifferent to the dissolving of weapons programmes and the quiet death of warrants in clerks' archives.

Rabbi Yehudah rose. Slower than last time, the left knee audibly protesting. He touched Enzo's shoulder as he passed — a brief pressure, a hand that had held Torah scrolls and infants and the hands of dying men and that distributed its touch with the economy of a man who knew how much a hand could carry.

"The letter to Luzzatto in Padua," he said from the doorway. "I will not send it yet. But I will not burn it."

"In case."

"In case." He touched the mezuzah. Kissed his fingers. Went.

The door closed. Mirela began clearing the cups. Enzo sat at the table with the fig in front of him and the broth's warmth fading from his hands and the light shifting through the window as the sun moved west over the rooftops of Cannaregio.

He picked up the fig. Split it open along the seam where the skin had already yielded. Inside, the flesh was red and dense with seeds, the color of a furnace mouth at the moment the temperature is right for gathering. He ate half. The sweetness was heavy, almost too much, the sugar concentrated by days of ripening that the fruit had somehow survived. He set the other half on the table.

His hands were idle. Grinder's hands with nothing to grind. The calluses would soften in a week, two weeks, the ridges smoothing the way a lens surface smooths under an abrasive that is too fine for the work, taking away what should remain. He pressed his thumbs against his fingertips and felt the ridges still there, still sharp, the topography of four years' work written into his skin.

The workbench stood against the far wall. Giacomo's tools. The calipers, closed to their last distance. The unfinished blank in its clamp, the grinding arc preserved. The glass-bead necklace lay where he had set it the night Serena crossed the water — among the calipers and chalk marks, eighteen beads of colour dimmed by dust that had begun, already, to settle over them. Becoming part of the bench. Becoming part of what the bench held.

Through the window, Venice. The rooftops and the sky above them, that particular April sky of the lagoon — not blue, not grey, but the color between, the color that glass takes when you hold it to the light at the angle where it is neither transparent nor opaque but something in between, carrying the light without releasing it. Clouds moved east. A gull turned above the rio, white against the uncertain sky, and was gone.

The warrant would sit in its archive. The weapon was ash, or would be. Rossetti was wherever Rossetti went when his work was done — back to the Rialto, back to the ships, back to whatever life existed behind the merchant's face and his careful, calibrated generosity. Viaro would recalculate. The Council would pretend the programme had never existed, the way Venice pretended about everything it wished to forget: not by denying but by not mentioning, which was more effective than denial and required no confession.

Nothing had been made just. The yellow circle was still on his doublet, folded on the chest by the window. The guild expulsion still held. His father was still dead, killed in a furnace explosion that was still, officially, an accident. The weapon was gone, but the men who commissioned it were not, and they would commission other things, in other rooms, with other hands.

What remained was smaller than justice and larger than survival. He had acted. The action had not saved him — a merchant's statecraft had saved him. But the action was still his. Twenty-eight calibrations, each one a choice, together a refusal that no treaty or politics or archive could undo because it had been done with his hands, in his father's tradition, for reasons that were his own and that no one else's reasons could diminish or replace.

He stood. Crossed to the workbench. Put his hands on the scored wood the way he had the night he came back from the lagoon, his palms flat, the dust cool beneath his calluses. The tools waited. The blank waited. The necklace waited, its beads holding their colours in the afternoon light.

Not today. The bench was not ready for him, or he was not ready for it. The distinction did not matter. What mattered was that it was here, and he was here, and the door was open, and the morning would come again tomorrow through the east window the way it always came, thin and gold and indifferent, and it would touch the table and the cup and the bench, and he would be in this room to see it.

He went back to the table. Sat. Ate the other half of the fig. The seeds caught between his teeth, small and gritty, like grinding compound, like sand, like the residue of something that had been broken down to its smallest components and that held, even at that scale, the capacity to grow.
