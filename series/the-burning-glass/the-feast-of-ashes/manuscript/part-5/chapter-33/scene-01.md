Salt air and the creak of the oarlock, and under them the older sound, the one the lagoon made when nothing moved on its surface but the boat and the light.

Enzo rowed. The rhythm was in his shoulders before his mind caught it — pull, lift, reach, drop — the motion seated so deep in his body that his hands found the stroke the way they found a grinding pass, by feel, by years. The sandolo moved across the flat water. Behind him Venice shrank to a line of rooftops and bell towers. Ahead, Murano rose from the haze the way it always rose, low and ordinary, a scatter of red tile and brick chimneys trailing smoke.

A thousand mornings he had made this crossing. Before dawn most times, the water black and the only navigation the furnace glow on the horizon — that red smear above Murano that never went out because the furnaces never went out, because glass does not wait for the convenience of the men who make it.

This morning the sun was already high. April sun, warm on the back of his neck. The light on the water was not the winter light he remembered from those last weeks — grey, flat, the colour of a lens ground too thin. This light moved. It broke on the surface of his wake and scattered into fragments that were green and gold and white, each one a small fire that lasted less than a second.

He did not hurry.

The yellow circle sat on his chest. The rotella gialla faced outward because that was the law and the law did not care whether you were rowing toward something or away from it. On the water, between the city and the island, the circle was visible to no one. A gull, perhaps. He was a man in a boat. For the duration of the crossing he was only that.

The island grew. He could make out the fondamenta now, the mooring posts, the low wall where the water opened to the lagoon. Behind it, the rooftops. The chimneys. Smoke from six, eight, ten furnaces — the morning fires, banked overnight, now stoked for the day's work. The sound of them reached him before the smell did: a low sustained breath, air being pulled into a space hotter than the air outside, a sound he had heard every working day for four years and that lived in the same part of his memory as his mother's voice and the scrape of his father's calipers.

Then the smell. Beechwood smoke and something mineral, the calcined lime they used in the batch, and under that the burnt-sweet smell of glass itself. He breathed it. His body leaned into it the way a body leans toward warmth in winter, involuntary, anterior to thought.

The sandolo touched the fondamenta wall. He shipped the oar and tied the painter to a ring set in the stone, the same ring he had used for years, his fingers knowing the knot the way they knew his own calluses. The boat settled against the wall and rocked twice and was still.

He climbed out.

Murano underfoot. Stone worn smooth by the traffic of glassmakers, the same stone that had been here when his father walked it, when Bardolino walked it as a young man with two complete hands and a knee that bent without complaint. Nothing had changed. The beechwood billets were stacked against the Barovier warehouse wall, drying in the salt air. A cat slept on a coiled rope. From behind the nearest furnace came the ring of a pontil rod struck against iron, bright and percussive, fading into the haze.

He walked. Not along the fondamenta but through the calle behind it, the narrow passage between the furnace walls where the heat leaked through the brick and the air was five degrees warmer than the air outside. His body knew this passage. The turn at the blocked well, the low lintel where he had learned to duck at fourteen and still ducked now out of the habit his spine had memorized. The second turning. The wider calle that opened onto the yard.

The Bardolino furnace.

He stopped at the edge of the yard. The gate was open — it was always open during working hours, the iron hinges rusted in position. Through it he could see the yard: the brick floor littered with the morning's debris — wood chips, a broken punty rod, a scatter of cullet that caught the light and threw it back in colours. The furnace building beyond, its chimney pouring smoke, the south wall darkened by decades of soot. The canal-side door. The workshop windows, shuttered against the glare.

He knew every brick. The cracked one at the south wall's corner that Bardolino said he would replace and never did. The patch of mortar above the workshop door where Tomaso had thrown a punty rod in anger. The threshold stone, hollowed by forty years of boots.

From inside, the sound of the glory hole. That deep, continuous roar, the throat of the furnace open and breathing. Voices underneath it — men calling to each other in the shorthand of the trade, words that had no meaning outside this building and that inside it meant the difference between a gather that held and a gather that fell. Someone laughed. The laugh was brief, swallowed by the roar.

Enzo stood in the yard. Not hiding. Not approaching the door. Standing on the brick in the April sun with the yellow circle on his chest and his hands at his sides, the grinding calluses catching the light where the skin was thickest, at the pads of his fingers and the heel of his right palm.

A worker crossed the yard carrying a crate of cullet. He saw Enzo. Looked at him. Looked at the yellow circle. Looked away. Kept walking. The crate went through the canal-side door and the man did not come back.

The furnace breathed. The chimney poured its smoke into the April sky, where it thinned and drifted south toward the lagoon and was gone. A wasp circled the broken punty rod, drawn by something Enzo could not see.

Minutes passed. He counted them by the shadow line creeping west on the yard wall. He had stood like this before — not here, but at the grinding wheel, waiting for the blank to cool before the next pass. Waiting was not patience. It was attention.

Another worker came through the yard. Younger — an apprentice, perhaps, from the way he carried his shoulders, hunched against the heat he had not yet learned to ignore. He glanced at Enzo and stopped. Then he turned and went back inside, quick, the way a boy moves when he has seen something he thinks his master should know about.

The wasp left the punty rod and circled Enzo's head once and departed. The shadow on the wall moved another handsbreadth.

Then the workshop door opened.

Bardolino came out.

Not all at once. The limp first — the right leg swinging wide to clear the threshold, the body tilting as the weight transferred across the bad knee. Then the shoulders, still broad, still filling the doorway. The leather apron, stained and scarred. The hands — enormous, burns layered over burns, the gold signet ring on the right hand catching the sun, the rampant lion holding its goblet. The iron-grey hair swept back from a forehead that was higher than Enzo remembered, the hairline retreating.

The eyes.

Pale grey-blue. Watery. Reddened at the rims from decades of staring into fire. They found Enzo across the yard — fifteen paces, perhaps twenty — and they stopped.

The old man stood in the doorway. The furnace breathed behind him, and the heat came through the door and made the air above his shoulders shimmer, so that his outline wavered at its edges, the way a thing seen through bad glass wavers, the shape present but the boundaries uncertain.

He looked older. The lines around his mouth cut deeper, the jaw thinned. The hands were the same — those hands did not age, or aged differently, the way tools age, growing more worn and more precise at the same time. But the rest of him had diminished. Reduced. The way a gather reduces when the temperature is too high and the glass burns off what is not essential until only the dense core remains.

He was still the maestro. The doorframe seemed to belong to him rather than the other way around. Forty years of standing before fire and telling it what to become had built an authority that was not posture but substance.

And Enzo was outside it.

The distance between them was twenty paces of brick. It was also four years of teaching and three years of silence and one night on the lagoon and a furnace explosion that was not an accident and twenty-eight calibrations ground into brass housings by hands the old man had trained. The distance held all of it. It did not resolve.

Bardolino's left hand went to his apron pocket. The motion was old, reflexive. His fingers closed around the millefiori piece, the small disc of fused coloured glass he had carried for decades, the thing he touched when his body required something to hold.

He stepped into the yard. The limp carried him three paces from the door, four, and then he stopped. His right knee would not take more without the particular gathering of will that walking cost him, and he did not gather it. He stood where the limp brought him and looked at Enzo across the brick.

Neither of them spoke.

The furnace roared. Inside, a man called for a pontil and another man answered. The sound of work continuing because work does not stop for the things that happen outside its walls. A gull passed over the yard, its shadow crossing the brick between them, quick and gone.

Enzo looked at the man who had taught him everything. How to hold a blank. How to read a surface by touch. How to hear the wheel's pitch change when the glass was ready. How to see — not with the eyes alone but with the hands, with the body, with the attention that was not concentration but surrender, the mind emptying until only the glass remained. Every correction, every cuff on the ear when his grip was wrong, every nod — that spare, reluctant nod — when the surface came true.

And the other lessons. The ones that were not taught but demonstrated. How to accept a commission you knew was wrong. How to love a boy like a son and use his hands for a purpose you would not name. How to protect and exploit in the same gesture, the way a mould gives shape to glass and also constrains it.

The sun was on both of them. It fell on the yellow circle and on the leather apron and on the brick between, impartial. Bardolino's hand moved in his pocket — Enzo could see the motion through the leather, the millefiori piece turning in its small repeated revolution.

The old man's mouth opened. Closed.

The yard held them. The furnace breathing behind one and the lagoon breathing behind the other, and between them the brick floor that both of them had walked ten thousand times in the years when walking it together was the ordinary shape of a morning.

Bardolino took another step. His right knee caught and held and released, and the step cost him something visible — a tightening across the shoulders, a fractional dip of the head — but it brought him closer. Sixteen paces now. Fifteen.

He stopped.

His hand came out of the apron pocket. The millefiori piece was in it — small, round, the coloured glass flowers fused into the clear disc, each element distinct, the whole inseparable. Red, cobalt, a green like deep water, a gold, a white. The flowers Bardolino's hands had made when those hands were young and making glass was the truest thing he knew how to do.

The old man held it in his scarred palm. The missing fingertip of his left hand pointed at the sky, the stump healed to a smooth cap of skin.

They looked at each other.

But first this. The standing. The looking. The fifteen paces of April light and old brick, and at each end a man who was not what the other needed him to be, and who was, nevertheless, the man who was there.

The furnace breathed. The shadow moved. The millefiori piece turned once more in Bardolino's hand, the coloured flowers catching the light, and for a moment — brief, fragile, the duration of a single gather's cooling — the glass held every colour at once.
