Bardolino's hands hung at his sides. The right one opened and closed once, the way it did when he was working a gather and the temperature was wrong — that involuntary flexing, the body's argument with the material before the mind stepped in to arbitrate. He stood ten paces from the furnace door with the yard between them and the April light falling across the flagstones in long parallels that made every crack and stain visible.

Enzo did not cross the distance.

The yard was smaller than he remembered. Four years of crossing it every morning in the dark, untying the sandolo and walking up the canal path and through the gate and across these same flagstones — and the yard had been a country, a territory belonging to the furnace and to the man who ran it. Now it was a rectangle of packed earth and stone, bounded by the workshop wall, the woodshed, the canal. Ordinary. The furnace chimney smoked above the roofline, thin and pale against the sky, and the smoke smelled the way it always smelled — of oak and salt and the mineral ghost of silica — but the smell reached him as information, not as belonging.

Bardolino looked at him. The pale grey-blue eyes, watery in the morning light, held steady. Iron-grey hair uncombed, the leather apron already tied over his doublet though it was early and the day's work had not begun. A tall man, broad through the shoulders, standing with his weight shifted to the left leg to spare the right knee. The gold signet ring caught the light when his hand flexed again and went still.

"You should not have come back to the island," Bardolino said.

"No."

A gull passed above the yard, its shadow crossing between them and gone. From the furnace came the muffled sound of someone moving a grate — Tomaso, perhaps, banking coals, performing the morning work that had once been part of the rhythm Enzo woke to.

"The guild document," Bardolino said. "The language was careful."

"I read it."

"Viaro drafted the clause himself. He left the door —"

"I know what he left."

Bardolino stopped. His mouth closed around the unfinished sentence the way glass closes around an air bubble — sealing it in, the shape of what was not said preserved inside the silence. He shifted his weight. The right knee hitched, and the small wince that crossed his face was the same wince Enzo had seen a thousand times, the grimace Bardolino thought he hid and never did, visible in the tightening around his eyes and in the way his left hand moved a fraction toward his thigh before he stopped it.

Neither of them spoke. The furnace breathed through its walls, that low steady exhalation, and the canal lapped at the quay stones behind Enzo, and between those two sounds the silence held its own shape — not empty but occupied, the way a finished lens holds the curvature ground into it. The silence was full of what they knew. The weapon. The twenty-eight calibrations. The five words Bardolino had spoken to Viaro in this same yard: *the boy acted alone*. The furnace still standing. The guild expulsion folded in Enzo's doublet. Giacomo.

None of it was named.

"You have your father's stubbornness," Bardolino said. His voice was lower than Enzo remembered, or perhaps the yard was simply quieter without the grinding wheel running, without the serventi calling to each other between the workshop and the woodshed. "It will destroy you."

"It saved me."

Bardolino's chin dropped half an inch. Not a nod. An acknowledgment that arrived in the body before the mind could shape it into agreement or refusal — the way a man flinches from heat, not because he has decided to flinch but because the skin understands before the will does.

He reached into his apron pocket.

Enzo knew what was there. He had seen the gesture ten thousand times — Bardolino's left hand disappearing into the leather pocket, the fingers closing around the small weight, the thumb beginning its circuit of the smooth surface. The gesture he made when he was thinking, when he was troubled, when the fire was wrong or the commission was difficult or a piece had cracked in the annealing oven and the loss had to be absorbed. The hand went in and the millefiori piece came to his fingers and the world steadied, or did not steady, but the hand had something to hold.

His fingers drew it out. The sphere sat on his open palm. Clear glass, no larger than a walnut, the surface polished to an evenness that decades of handling had only improved. Inside it, suspended in the crystal matrix, the flowers. Red, white, blue, gold. Tiny and exact, each one drawn from a separate cane, each petal placed by a nineteen-year-old apprentice who had spent a Sunday afternoon making something no one asked for because his hands needed to know they could.

Bardolino looked at it. The morning light entered the glass and the flowers brightened, each color pulling its fraction of the spectrum from the white light the way the beads of Serena's necklace pulled theirs — not taking, not competing, simply being what they were. The light passed through and cast a small constellation of colour on Bardolino's scarred palm.

"This is the best piece I ever made," he said. "I made it when I was young, and the glass was honest."

He held it out.

His arm extended across the distance between them — not far, six paces perhaps, close enough that Enzo could see the scars on the back of his hand, the thickened knuckles, the missing tip of the left ring finger where the shears had taken it thirty years ago. The enormous hand, steady now, open, the millefiori piece sitting in the center of the palm like a coal that had cooled to the temperature of the body holding it.

Enzo stepped forward. Two steps. Three. He stopped within arm's reach.

The piece was warm. He could feel the warmth before he touched it, radiating from the glass the way heat radiates from a crucible after the fire has been drawn — not the fire's heat but the vessel's, the temperature the material holds when the source is gone. Forty years of Bardolino's hand. Forty years of the pocket, the apron, the body's constant warmth transferred into the glass and held there.

He took it.

The weight settled into his palm. Heavier than it looked. The flowers were sharp through the crystal, each one preserved in the clarity that only the best glass achieves. No bubbles, no striations, no clouding. Red like the furnace mouth at gathering temperature. Blue like deep lagoon water seen through cristallo. Gold like morning light on a grinding surface, that thin precise colour that arrived through the east window and touched whatever it found.

Bardolino's hand dropped to his side. Empty. The fingers curled once against his thigh and opened.

They stood in the yard with the furnace behind Bardolino and the canal behind Enzo, and the millefiori piece was between them in the way that it had always been between them — the proof that craft could be its own reason, that a man could make a thing for no purpose other than the making, and that such a thing could survive the man who made it and the failures the man accumulated afterward. The piece did not forgive. Glass does not forgive. It holds its shape or it breaks, and this piece had held its shape for thirty-eight years through every compromise and every silence and every morning Bardolino stood at his furnace and chose the fire over the truth, and the holding was not innocence but endurance, the particular stubbornness of a material that does not care what the hands that made it did after the making was done.

This was not reconciliation. Enzo understood this the way he understood a grinding surface — through his hands, through the specific physical knowledge of what the material could hold and what it could not. The bond between them was broken. The teaching was real. The four years were real. The lessons — pressure, angle, patience, the listening that a grinder does with his fingertips — those were real, and they lived in his hands the way the flowers lived in the glass, embedded, structural, inseparable from the medium that held them. Bardolino had taught him everything. Bardolino had betrayed him. Both statements occupied the same space without cancelling each other, the way two colours occupy the same bead of glass without mixing.

He could not say any of this. Neither could Bardolino. The language available to them was the language they had always spoken: the language of material, of craft, of things made and held and given. The millefiori piece said what neither of them could. That the work was real. That the teaching survived the teacher. That something honest could come from a man who had not been honest, the way true glass can be ground on a wheel that is imperfect, if the grinder's hands are good enough to compensate.

Enzo closed his fingers around the piece. The flowers disappeared into his fist. The warmth pressed against his calluses, against the grinding ridges that Bardolino's instruction had built.

"Maestro," he said.

The word came out before he chose it. The old word, the formal address, stripped now of everything it had carried for four years — the obedience, the aspiration, the gratitude, the rage — stripped down to its root, which was only this: *teacher*. A man who had shown him what his hands could do. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Bardolino's jaw worked once. The pale eyes were wet, and he did not hide it, and he did not look away.

He said nothing.

Enzo turned. He walked across the yard, past the woodshed, through the gate. The canal path was empty. Morning light lay along the water in a band of white that broke and reformed with the current's motion. His sandolo was tied where he had left it, the rope dark with damp, the hull rocking in the small wake of a passing barge.

The millefiori piece was warm in his closed hand. The flowers he could not see were there. Red, white, blue, gold. Held in their crystal, unchanged, the work of a young man's Sunday afternoon preserved inside the ruin of what that young man became. He did not open his hand to look at them. He did not need to. The weight was enough. The warmth was enough.

Behind him, in the yard, Bardolino had not moved. Enzo knew this without turning. He knew the way Bardolino stood when something had been taken from him. The weight on the left leg, the right knee locked, the shoulders drawn back as though the body could compensate by posture for what the hands had released. He would stand there. He would stand there until the stillness became unbearable, and then his left hand would go to his apron pocket, and his fingers would close around nothing, and the nothing would be the exact size and weight and temperature of what had been there for thirty-eight years, and then he would turn and walk back into the furnace, because the furnace was what remained, and the fire did not require him to be more than he was.

Enzo untied the sandolo. Two wraps unwound, the half hitch released, the rope falling into the hull with a sound like a breath finished. He stepped in. Took up the oar. The blade found the water and the water gave, and the boat moved, and Murano began its slow recession behind him — the furnace smoke, the rooftops, the bell tower, the island where his father had died and his master had taught him and the two acts were part of the same history, inseparable, ground into the same surface.

The lagoon opened ahead. Venice waited across the water, low and grey and indifferent. The yellow circle was on his doublet. The guild expulsion was in his pocket. The millefiori piece was in his hand, warming against his palm with the residual heat of a man who had loved him as well as he could, which had not been well enough, and which had been the most Bardolino had.

He rowed. The oar dipped and rose. The wake spread behind him and closed. Ahead, the light on the water shifted as a cloud moved and the sun came through, and for a moment the whole surface of the lagoon turned to glass — flat, luminous, holding the sky and the city and the distance between them in a single clear plane — and then the cloud returned and the water was water again, dark and moving, carrying him where he chose to go.
