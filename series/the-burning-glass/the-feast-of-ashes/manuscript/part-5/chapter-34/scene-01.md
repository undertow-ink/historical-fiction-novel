The sound came back before anything else.

A low, steady whisper — stone on glass, the grit finding its purchase, the blank beginning to yield. The grinding wheel turned under his hands and the room filled with the sound the way water fills a vessel: from the bottom up, pressing into corners, climbing the walls, reaching the ceiling beam where the dried herbs hung and the plaster cracked and the smoke of ten thousand meals had darkened the wood to the colour of old iron. The sound found every surface and held it. The room remembered.

Not Giacomo's wheel. The old one had died with its maker — the shaft warped, the bearing seized, the stone cratered beyond truing. What turned now was new. Enzo had built it from salvaged parts over three weeks: a bearing housing pulled from a broken lathe at the iron-monger's near the Rialto, a grinding stone cut from a slab he had carried across two bridges and up the narrow stairs, a shaft he had turned himself on a borrowed pole lathe in the carpenter's yard on the Fondamenta degli Ormesini, paying for the use with the last of the mending money. The treadle was pine, green and unseasoned, and it flexed too much under his foot. He would replace it when the wood dried. The frame was oak from a broken boat rib, still carrying the smell of the lagoon in its grain.

It was not a good wheel. The stone was coarser than he wanted, the bearing loose by a quarter-turn, the whole assembly prone to a vibration at high speed that would ruin fine work. It was adequate. It was his.

He pressed the blank against the stone. His right foot found the treadle's rhythm — push, release, push — and the wheel's pitch rose and steadied, and his hands read the surface the way they had been taught to read it: through the fingertips, through the calluses, through the vibration that travelled up the glass and into the bones of his wrists and told him what his eyes could not. The grain was rough. He was grinding the concave face first, because Bardolino had taught him to do the hard thing first, the thing that required faith in his hands when his eyes could not help, and the teaching was still true even when the teacher was not, and Enzo no longer needed to resolve that contradiction to use it.

The blank was small. A reading lens, three fingers across, the kind Gritti needed for the fine print of the new Aldine editions that arrived at his shop faster than his eyes could keep pace with. The letter had come through Rabbi Yehudah's contact — a single line in Gritti's cramped scholar's hand, the Latin bent under the weight of too many abbreviations: *The boy who ground my spectacles — does he still work? I need stronger ones. My Alhazen is becoming a blur.* Not a commission. Gritti would not have used that word. A request from a man going blind to a man who could help, passed through the quiet channels that connected the quarter to the city it lived inside, the way a canal connects one rio to another without either of them ceasing to be what it is.

The letter sat on the new bench, pinned under a grinding form. Beside it: the tools. Not Giacomo's. Enzo's own — calipers he had bought from a spectacle-maker on the Merceria who was retiring and selling his instruments cheap, a set of grinding laps cast from a mould he had carved himself, polishing cloths, a jar of emery mixed with olive oil, a radius gauge he had filed from a strip of brass. The tools were arranged the way Bardolino had taught him to arrange them: in order of use, left to right, each one reachable without lifting his eyes from the work. The habit was Bardolino's. The bench was his.

Against the far wall, three paces from where Enzo sat, Giacomo's workbench waited. Unchanged. The dust had thickened in the weeks since he had last touched it — a fine grey film over the calipers, the chalk marks, the clamp that still held the unfinished blank in its grinding arc. Mirela did not clean it. Enzo did not clean it. The dust was not neglect. It was the workbench's own slow labour, the accumulation of time made visible on a surface that would not be used again, the way silt accumulates on a canal floor where no current runs.

Between the two benches — the old and the new, the dead and the living — morning light fell through the east window in a band that narrowed as it crossed the floor and widened where it struck the wall. Late spring light, warm, carrying the smell of the canal and the baker's yeast and the salt of the lagoon that reached every room in this city because the city was built on the lagoon's body and the lagoon did not forget.

The light touched the new bench. It found the glass-bead necklace.

Eighteen beads on a silk cord, coiled among the grinding forms where he had placed it the morning he set up the wheel. The beads woke the way they always woke when the light reached them — not all at once but in sequence, each colour pulling its fraction of the spectrum from the white light, the way voices in a choir enter one by one and build a sound that none of them could make alone. Amber first, warm and thick. Then cobalt, that deep mineral blue. The green so dark it was nearly black. The red like a furnace mouth at gathering temperature. Gold, pale blue, violet. Each bead the work of a single breath through a gather of molten glass, each one shaped by hands that were not here.

The light passed through the beads and emerged on the other side altered. Small points of colour fell across the grinding surface — amber, blue, green — each one a refraction, a bending of the light through the curved glass the way a lens bends the light that passes through it. The coloured points moved as the sun moved, drifting across the stone in their slow daily passage, and where they fell they changed the surface, made it briefly something other than grey grit and ground glass and the residue of work. The colours did not last. They were there in the morning and gone by midday, when the sun climbed past the window's angle, and each morning they came back, faithful, indifferent to whether anyone watched them arrive.

He did not look at the necklace while he worked. He did not need to. The coloured light lay at the edge of his vision the way certain presences lay at the edge of thought — known, carried, not examined. The warmth that glass holds after the fire has gone out.

The wheel turned. Grit whispered against cristallo. His hands made their slow passes, the pressure even, the angle constant, his wrists absorbing the stone's vibration the way a hull absorbs the water's motion. The concave face deepened. He checked it by touch — thumb across the centre, fingertips along the rim — and felt the curve building, not yet true, the radius still too long by a fraction he could measure with his hands but not with words. Three more passes. Perhaps four.

The doorway changed.

He did not hear her approach. Mirela moved through the house the way water moves through a building's foundation — present everywhere, audible only when you stopped and listened. But the air in the doorway shifted, a warmth where there had been a draught, and he knew she was there the way he knew when the blank's temperature changed under his hands: not by looking but by the alteration in what surrounded it.

She stood with her shoulder against the frame. Her arms were folded, her hands tucked beneath them, the red knuckles hidden. She wore the dark kerchief, the working dress, the apron she put on each morning and did not remove until the brazier was banked and the dishes were clean and the day's labour had been converted into the particular exhaustion that passed, in this house, for rest.

She watched him grind. Her face held no expression he could name. Naming would have required him to look away from the work, and he did not look away, but he saw her at the edge of his vision the way he saw the coloured light from the beads — present, peripheral, altering the shape of the room by standing in it.

The wheel turned. His foot on the treadle, the treadle on the shaft, the shaft on the stone, the stone on the glass. His father's craft, taught by his father's killer, practised now in his father's house with tools that were not his father's, on a wheel that was not his father's, for a purpose that was not his father's. The chain of hands. Giacomo's on the first grinding laps Enzo had ever touched, showing him how to hold the blank, how to feel the surface, how to listen for the wheel's pitch to change when the glass was ready. Bardolino's on his wrists, correcting his angle, pressing his fingers into the right position. His own hands now, alone, carrying the instruction of both men in their calluses the way glass carries the memory of the fire that formed it.

On Giacomo's workbench, among the calipers and chalk marks and the dust of three years, the millefiori piece sat where Enzo had placed it the day he finished the wheel. Small, round, clear glass holding its coloured flowers — red, white, blue, gold — each element distinct, the whole inseparable. The best piece Bardolino had ever made, when the glass was honest. It had found its place beside Giacomo's last measurement, beside the unfinished blank in its clamp. The two men who had shaped Enzo, present in their objects, absent in their bodies. The flowers in the glass did not resolve the contradiction between them. They held it.

He ground. The sound filled the room. Through the open window the canal carried its morning traffic — a gondola's oar, a woman's voice, the slap of water against stone. Ordinary sounds. The sounds of a city conducting its commerce, its cruelties, its small daily acts of survival that were neither heroic nor cowardly but simply continuous, the way the lagoon's tide was continuous, rising and falling without reference to what the men who lived on it had done or failed to do.

The trunk sat against the wall beneath the window. Packed. Buckled. The brass corners had lost their shine in the weeks since Mirela had fastened the straps. Dust had begun to settle on the leather — the same dust that settled on everything in this room, the dust of plaster and dried herbs and the city's own mineral breath. Neither of them had unpacked it. Neither had mentioned unpacking it. The trunk waited the way the workbench waited, the way the letter to Luzzatto in Padua waited in Rabbi Yehudah's study: a door unlatched, an alternative preserved, the readiness itself a kind of honesty. They were staying. They could leave. Both things were true, and the trunk held them both without requiring a decision.

Mirela crossed to the brazier. He heard her kneel, heard the steel strike flint — three strikes, never more — heard the kindling catch. She was making the morning fire. The smoke would curl up and find the ceiling beam and travel along it to the cracks in the plaster, and the smell would be the same smell it had been every morning of his life in this room, the smell of a woman keeping a house alive because the house was what she had and because keeping it alive was the form her stubbornness took, the way grinding was the form his took.

The blank was cooling under his hands. He lifted it from the stone and held it to the light. The concave face was roughed in — not finished, not close to finished, but the curve was there, ground into the glass by his hands and the stone and the hours between dawn and now. The light passed through the blank and emerged on the other side bent, redirected, focused to a point on the wall where it made a small bright circle. Not sharp. Not yet. The radius was wrong by a fraction he could feel and would correct in the next pass and the pass after that, grinding the surface finer each time, moving from coarse to fine to polish, the way a lens-grinder moves from rough truth to precision — not by arriving at the answer but by removing, grain by grain, everything that is not the answer, until what remains is clear.

He set the blank in its clamp. Stood. His back ached from the stool and his right knee — his knee, not Bardolino's, though the old man's limp was somewhere in his future if he sat at this wheel long enough — protested as he straightened. The calluses on his fingertips were white with grinding compound, the familiar grit seated in the whorls of his skin.

Morning light lay across both benches. The old one held its dust and its memory and its silence. The new one held his tools, his work, the coloured light from eighteen glass beads, and a millefiori piece that a young man had made on a Sunday afternoon when making glass was the truest thing he knew.

From the brazier, the sound of water heating. Mirela hummed — a nigun, wordless, the melody rising and falling in the small room the way smoke rises and falls before it finds its way out. She did not look at the wheel. She did not need to. The sound of it was enough. The sound of her son grinding glass in his dead father's house, in a city that had tried to break him, with hands that carried the marks of a craft he had no legal right to practise, making a lens for a bookseller who was going blind.

The yellow circle was on his doublet, folded on the chest by the window. The rotella gialla faced the wall, the saffron dye dulled by years of sun and sweat and the particular friction of being worn against a body that had not chosen it. Outside, the gates of the quarter were open. They would close at dusk. Between the opening and the closing, the patrol boats would pass, and the yellow circles would move through the calles, visible, counted, known. The world had not changed. The world would not change. Not for him, not for the twenty-eight calibrations, not for a father who had seen clearly and died for the seeing.

He sat down. Fitted the blank back against the stone. His foot found the treadle.

The grinding wheel turned. The sound filled the room. Through the east window the morning entered, thin and gold and indifferent, and it touched what it found: the table, the kiddush cup, the old bench and the new one, the tools and the beads and the flowers in the glass, the woman at the brazier and the man at the wheel, the trunk against the wall and the dust on every surface, and all of it held, all of it present, all of it the ordinary equipment of a life that had not been made simple or just or safe but that was, nevertheless, being lived.
