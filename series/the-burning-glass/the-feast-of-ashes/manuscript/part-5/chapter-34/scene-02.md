On the bench beside the grinding forms, a sheet of scrap paper. His father's chalk. He had been sketching in the early mornings before the grinding began — not lenses but an arrangement of lenses, two of them set in a tube, one at each end, the concave and the convex aligned at a distance he was still calculating. A device for seeing far. He had read about the principle in Gritti's Alhazen — the geometry of light bent through curved glass, the way a convex surface gathered rays to a point and a concave surface spread them, and what might happen if you placed both in sequence and looked through.

The sketch was rough. The calculations rougher. He did not have the glass for it, or the brass for the housing, or the years of grinding that the surfaces would require. The device was a thing he would not finish. Perhaps no one would finish it, not in his lifetime, not in the lifetime after his. But the sketching was its own kind of grinding — the chalk moving across the paper the way the blank moved across the lap, attending, measuring, wearing away what was not needed until the shape beneath emerged.

He set the paper aside. Picked up the blank. Returned it to the wheel.

The treadle rocked. The lap turned. Tripoli compound, fine-grained, mixed with water to a paste the colour of clay. He applied it with his thumb. The blank went down against the spinning surface and the sound changed — higher now, thinner, the pitch that meant the grit was working at the smaller imperfections, the ones invisible to the eye but present to the hand.

The blank grew warmer under his fingers. Friction — not the furnace's heat but the quieter warmth of abrasion, of material yielding to pressure and time. His father had known this warmth. Bardolino had taught him to read it, to know by the temperature alone whether the pass was cutting true or drifting.

Outside, a bell. San Geremia, marking the hour. The sound entered the room and passed through it and joined the grinding's hiss, two sounds occupying the same air without interference, each carrying its own measure of time — the bell's stroke counting hours, the wheel's turning counting passes, and between them the slower time of the glass itself, which measured nothing and held everything.

He lifted the blank. Wiped it with the rag. Held it to the window.

Morning light passed through the lens and bent, throwing a circle of concentrated brightness onto the far wall — onto Giacomo's workbench, onto the millefiori piece, onto the dust. The circle was not yet sharp. The surface needed the rouge pass, the final polish that would bring the curvature to its true shape, the shape that Gritti's failing eyes required. But the light moved through the glass and arrived where he aimed it, gathered and redirected by the surface his hands had cut.

He turned the blank. Slowly. A quarter-turn, watching how the light responded, reading the refraction for flaws the way his father had taught him and Bardolino had refined. A slight unevenness at the eastern edge. He could feel it with his thumb. He would correct it.

He set the blank back on the wheel. Applied rouge. The finest compound — iron oxide ground to a powder so fine it felt like nothing between his fingers, like air with weight. He mixed it with water. Spread it on the lap. Put his foot to the treadle.

The sound filled the room. Higher than the tripoli, almost a whisper, the sound of the last imperfections being worn away. The sound of precision. Of patience. Of a maker alone with his material in a room where the light came through the east window and touched what it found and moved on, indifferent to whether the hands it illuminated belonged to a man with a guild or a man without one, a man the city honoured or a man it merely tolerated, a man whose craft had been used for war or a man who had refused and lost everything except the craft itself.

The wheel turned. The glass answered. His hands — scarred, roughened, callused, his father's hands — held the blank against the lap and felt the surface come closer, pass by pass, to true. Not perfect. True. The difference mattered. Perfection was a word for men who had never ground glass. Truth was what the surface achieved when the grinder's hands were honest and the pressure was even and the attention did not waver, and it was enough.

The morning moved. The light moved. The coloured points from the beads crossed the bench and faded as the sun climbed past the angle that produced them. The millefiori piece held its flowers in the stillness of Giacomo's dust. The yellow circle hung on its stool. Venice continued outside the window, ordinary and indifferent, a city of water and stone conducting its morning without reference to the man grinding glass in a room in Cannaregio.

Enzo worked. He rotated the blank, examined it, returned it to the wheel. The glass was not yet what it would become. He ground it anyway. The sound filled the small room — the hiss of rouge on glass, the treadle's creak, the lap's turning — the sound of a surface being made, slowly, by hands that knew what they were for.
