# Voice Guide — The Feast of Ashes

This document defines the narrative voice for *The Feast of Ashes*, Book One of *The Burning Glass* trilogy. Every page of prose must conform to these rules. The writer agent loads this document into Layer 1 of every writing prompt.

---

## Point of View

**POV type:** Close third person

**POV discipline:** Strict. The narrator has access only to Enzo's perceptions, thoughts, and memories. The prose cannot describe what Enzo does not see, hear, feel, or know. If another character is angry but hiding it well, Enzo (and the reader) must infer it from behavior — never from direct access to the other character's mind. The narrator may describe Enzo's unconscious body language ("his hand found the edge of the workbench") but not his unconscious motivations — those must emerge through action and choice.

**Exception — Bardolino chapters:** Five to six chapters are told from Vittorio Bardolino's close-third POV. These chapters show the conspiracy from the inside and are clearly marked by a section header with Bardolino's name. Bardolino's voice is distinct from Enzo's: older, more measured, more self-justifying. His chapters tend toward longer sentences, more formal diction, and a habit of aestheticizing the moral compromises he makes.

**POV shifts:** Only at chapter breaks. Never within a chapter. A chapter is either entirely Enzo or entirely Bardolino.

## Tense

**Primary tense:** Past tense.

**Exceptions:** None. No present-tense sequences, no future-tense speculation. Flashbacks are handled through past perfect only at the entry point ("He had been fourteen when his father died"), then transition to simple past. Dreams, if they occur, are rendered in past tense with imagery that signals their unreality. This novel keeps tense absolutely consistent.

## Register

**Formality level:** Literary but transparent. The prose should feel crafted but never self-conscious — the reader notices the story, not the sentences. Vocabulary is precise and specific (use the right word for a glass tool, a type of boat, a cut of fabric) but does not send readers to a dictionary more than once per chapter. Sentences are structurally varied but not acrobatic. The prose admires clarity the way a lens grinder admires a clean surface: complexity is tolerated only when it reveals something that simplicity cannot.

**Narrative distance:** Close. We are near the surface of Enzo's consciousness — experiencing what he experiences, in his sensory language. The narrator does not editorialize or foreshadow ("little did he know"). The narrator does not intrude with historical context ("in those days, Venice was..."). Context is embedded naturally in Enzo's thoughts and observations. He does not explain his world to the reader — he lives in it.

**Period calibration:** The prose evokes the late fifteenth century through specificity of detail (objects, gestures, social rituals, the texture of daily life) rather than through archaic syntax. Dialogue uses a slightly elevated register — no contractions, formal forms of address ("Maestro," "Signore"), occasional Italian/Venetian terms — but remains comprehensible to modern ears. The prose avoids post-1500 concepts (no "psychology," no "unconscious," no "irony" as a critical term). Characters think in terms of honor, obligation, craft, God, and the body — not in modern psychological vocabulary. Avoid: "she felt conflicted" (modern). Use: "two thoughts pulled at her like ropes on a capstan" (period-appropriate metaphor).

## Sentence Rhythm

**Default rhythm:** A mix of medium and short sentences, with occasional long sentences for description or reflection. The default pulse is steady and muscular — not lyrical, not clipped, but purposeful. Most paragraphs contain 4-7 sentences. Most sentences are 10-25 words. One in ten may stretch to 40+.

**Variation rules:**
- **Furnace scenes / craft work:** Rhythm follows the work — short sentences for precise actions ("He scored the glass. Tapped. The neck cracked clean."), longer sentences for the meditative quality of repetitive labor.
- **Danger / tension:** Sentence length drops. Fragments appear. Paragraphs shorten to 1-3 sentences. White space increases. The prose accelerates.
- **Emotional peaks:** The prose goes quiet and precise. Rather than amplifying, it contracts. The most devastating moments get the sparest treatment — a single image, an action without commentary, a sentence that ends before the reader expects it to.
- **Reflection / memory:** Sentences lengthen. Subordinate clauses accumulate. The prose breathes more slowly, allowing Enzo's thoughts to circle and settle.
- **Dialogue-heavy scenes:** Narration between dialogue lines is minimal and physical — gestures, glances, small actions. No long narrative paragraphs breaking up fast conversation.
- **Description / setting:** One vivid sentence per sense. Resist the urge to describe everything. Three precise details evoke a place better than ten general ones.

## Metaphor and Imagery Style

**Imagery source world:** Enzo's world. His metaphors come from glassmaking (heat, light, molten material, clarity, opacity, fracture), the lagoon (water, tides, fog, salt), the body (hands, eyes, breath, hunger, pain), and fire (always fire). He does not reach for metaphors from agriculture, warfare, or any world he has not inhabited. When he encounters something new, he understands it through the lens of what he already knows — a political negotiation is "like working a bubble in hot glass: push too hard and it pops, too gently and it sags and thins."

**Bardolino's imagery** draws from a broader vocabulary — art, music, cuisine, classical learning — reflecting his education and worldliness. His metaphors are more polished, more deliberate, more self-aware. Where Enzo's images are instinctive and physical, Bardolino's are curated.

**Density:** One strong image per page. Two at most. Resist clustering metaphors — they cancel each other. When a metaphor lands, trust it. Do not explain it, extend it, or follow it with a weaker version of the same idea.

**Style:** Concrete and physical. Images should be things you can see, touch, hear, smell. Abstract metaphors ("the glass of his resolve," "the furnace of his ambition") are banned. Every image must be grounded in something real. Prefer verbs over adjectives: "light fractured through the lens" over "the fractured light of the lens."

## Emotional Approach

**How emotions are conveyed:** Through the body first, then through action, then through the rhythm of the prose. Enzo does not think "I am afraid." His stomach tightens. His hands go still. He counts his breaths without deciding to. The reader infers his emotional state from the constellation of physical signals, the choices he makes, and the things he notices (a frightened person notices exits; a grieving person notices absence).

**Restraint level:** High. The prose trusts the reader. It does not name emotions, does not explain why a moment matters, does not signal how the reader should feel. Understatement is the dominant mode. The most emotionally powerful moments are rendered with the least ornamentation — as if the prose itself is afraid to look too closely. When Enzo remembers his father, the prose does not say "grief overwhelmed him." It describes the specific, physical, unrepeatable detail that triggers the memory — a particular smell of flux, a chip in a pontil rod — and lets the weight accumulate.

**Exception:** When Enzo witnesses the furnace — when he is in the presence of the craft at its most intense — the prose opens. The restraint lifts. Glass-working is the one context where Enzo's perception becomes almost ecstatic, where the prose is allowed to be lyrical. This controlled release makes the furnace scenes the emotional core of the novel: they are the only place where Enzo (and the prose) feel fully free.

**The role of silence and absence:** The novel is structured around things Enzo does not say, does not ask, and refuses to think about. His father's death is a gravitational center that the narrative orbits without approaching directly until the final act. Gaps in dialogue — places where a character changes the subject, or where the prose jumps forward past a conversation's most painful moment — are deliberate. Trust the reader to fill the silence.

## Physical Intimacy and Sex

**Register:** Literary explicit. Physical detail rendered through the novel's sensory language — bodies, hands, breath, heat, texture, pressure, weight. Nothing euphemistic ("their bodies joined," "he entered her garden"). Nothing pornographic (no clinical anatomy, no performance). The model: Hilary Mantel's devastating precision applied to the body; Ian McEwan's physicality embedded in architecture; Sally Rooney's directness — bodies described without apology or mystification. Name body parts directly when needed. There is nothing literary about euphemism.

**Imagery source:** Same as the rest of the novel. Sex scenes use the existing metaphor system — glass, fire, light, grinding, the lagoon — not a separate romantic vocabulary. The furnace, the grinding wheel, the moment glass yields to the hand: these images extend naturally into the body. Do not introduce new metaphor families for sex. Do not shift register upward (more "literary") or downward (more "raw"). The voice stays the same. The content changes; the prose does not. Use the glass metaphors sparingly during the actual sex — one per scene, maximum two. Let the body be a body. Save the larger metaphorical moves for the aftermath, where Enzo's mind reassembles what his body just experienced.

**The yellow circle:** Always present or deliberately absent. The yellow badge sewn to Enzo's doublet is the third body in every intimate scene — the world's judgment on his skin. In the first encounter (Ch22), the badge is physically present: Enzo keeps his shirt on instinctively, Serena removes it, touches the circle on his bare chest. In subsequent encounters, vary how it appears: on the floor with discarded clothing, visible but not centered. In the final encounter (Ch31), it is absent — Enzo is in his own home, unmarked for the first and last time. The absence is as powerful as the presence.

**Restraint:** Follow the existing rule: "The most devastating moments get the sparest treatment." Sex scenes should be shorter than the reader expects. The arc moves toward less, not more — the first encounter has the most physical description (~1,200-1,500 words of the act itself), the final encounter the least (~1,000-1,300 words). Readers who want more will fill the silence. Trust them.

**Scene structure:** Each sex scene follows four beats:
1. **The approach** — why now, why here, established by preceding narrative
2. **The crossing** — the moment of commitment: a touch, a decision, a garment removed
3. **The act** — sensory, physical, minimal interiority. Let bodies speak. No internal monologue during sex.
4. **The aftermath** — stillness, concrete detail, the world reasserting itself. The furnace audible through walls. The canal outside. The yellow circle on the floor. The aftermath is as important as the act. Sex in this novel is not escape from the world but confrontation with it.

**POV constraint:** The novel is strictly Enzo's close third. Serena's experience is accessible only through what Enzo perceives. He reads her responses the way he reads glass: through touch, sound, heat, subtle changes in resistance and yield. Her experience is rendered through his perception of her body's signals, not through direct access to her mind.

**Banned in intimacy scenes:** The general banned-word list applies with doubled force. Additionally never use: "waves of pleasure," "electric" / "electricity," "exploded" / "shattered" (as orgasm metaphor), "claimed" (as a verb for kissing or touching), "hungrily" / "greedily," "moaned" (find the specific sound), "whispered his/her name" (show who speaks through action), "their eyes locked," "aching need," "molten core," "taut with desire." These are romance-genre tells. The voice of this novel does not use them.

### Sample 4: Intimacy Scene

Her fingers found the ties of his doublet and worked them open with the same economy she used on ledger clasps — no fumbling, no ceremony. The yellow circle appeared as the fabric parted, bright against his undershirt in the half-light from the canal window. She did not look away from it. She had not looked away from it on the fondamenta in September, and she did not look away now. Her hand flattened over the circle, and through the linen he felt the specific pressure of each callus — the ridge at the base of her forefinger where she gripped the quill, the roughness on her thumb from the counting beads. He knew those calluses. He had noticed them months ago across her father's account table, reading them the way he read grit patterns on a grinding lap. Now they pressed against his chest, and his breath changed, and the sound of the canal outside was the same sound it always was, and nothing in the room was the same.

## Dialogue Style

**Dialogue realism level:** Lightly stylized. Dialogue should sound speakable — read it aloud — but is trimmed of the true repetitions, false starts, and filler of natural speech. Characters speak with purpose. Every line either reveals character, advances plot, or creates tension. If a line does none of these, cut it.

**Dialect and accent:** Dialogue is rendered in English but flavored with Venetian/Italian terms where they are untranslatable or atmospheric:
- Forms of address: *Maestro*, *Signore*, *Signora*, *ragazzo* (boy, used for apprentices)
- Craft terms: *fornace* (furnace), *canna da soffio* (blowpipe), *pontello* (pontil), *cristallo*
- Place terms: *campo* (square), *calle* (street), *fondamenta* (canal-side walkway), *rio* (small canal)
- Exclamations: *Per Dio*, *Madonna*, *Dio santo*
- Italian terms are italicized on first use, then plain on subsequent use.
- No phonetic rendering of accents. Differences in speech are shown through vocabulary and syntax, not spelling.
- Enzo's speech is direct, sometimes blunt, with a craftsman's habit of specificity ("not hot — cherry-red, just before orange").
- Bardolino's speech is more elaborate, with courtier-like turns of phrase and a tendency toward conditional constructions ("It would not be unreasonable to consider...").
- Other characters are differentiated by rhythm: short, clipped sentences for soldiers and dockworkers; complex, subordinated sentences for clerics and patricians.

**Dialogue mechanics:**
- Tags: "said" for 80% of attributions. "asked" when needed. Action beats for the rest. No "exclaimed," "declared," "whispered" (show whispering through context and action). Absolutely no adverb tags ("said quietly," "asked nervously").
- Long exchanges: After the first few attributed lines, rely on alternation rhythm. Re-attribute only when the reader might lose track (after 4+ untagged lines, or after a narrative interruption).
- Interruptions: em-dash at the point of interruption. The interrupted speaker does not finish their sentence.
- Subtext: Characters in this world rarely say what they mean directly. Venetians especially speak in layers — the surface meaning, the implied meaning, and sometimes a third meaning visible only to others present. Dialogue should reward rereading.

## Sample Paragraphs

### Sample 1: Tension Scene (Furnace)

The heat wall hit him three steps from the glory hole. He stopped, let his skin adjust, the way Maestro Bardolino had taught him in his first week — *stand until the heat becomes a sound, then move.* It was a high sound tonight, a singing in the air above the crucible, which meant the melt had passed twelve hundred and was still climbing. Too hot. The cristallo would yellow if they didn't pull it soon.

He looked for Bardolino. The maestro was not at his usual station. The two serventi worked the bench in silence, gathering and shaping without direction, their faces orange and slick in the furnace light. The back door — the one that led to the storeroom no apprentice was permitted to enter — was closed. But the padlock hung open on its hasp, and a light moved behind the gap beneath the door.

Enzo set down his pontil rod. He did not decide to walk toward the storeroom. His feet carried him there the way water finds a crack.

### Sample 2: Reflective Scene (The Lagoon)

He sat on the fondamenta with his legs hanging over the water and ate the bread he had saved from morning. The lagoon was the color of pewter today, flat and textureless under a sky that could not commit to rain. Somewhere beyond the mudflats a barge was moving, its square sail a thumbnail of brown against the gray. He watched it and thought of nothing. Or tried to think of nothing. His father had been good at this — sitting still, watching water, letting the mind go blank the way glass goes blank when you cool it too fast, all the color shocked out of it.

But Enzo was not his father. Enzo's mind would not blank. It circled back, always, to the same questions. The storeroom. The components laid out on the oilcloth. The shape they would make if assembled — and the shape did not match any instrument he had seen in four years of apprenticeship. He broke the bread into smaller pieces without eating them, dropping crumbs into the water where the gray fish held their patient stations.

### Sample 3: Dialogue Scene

"You ground the concave face first." Bardolino turned the lens blank in his fingers, holding it to the window where the light could find its flaws. "Always. You know why."

"Because the concave surface determines the focal—"

"No. Because the concave surface is the one you cannot see while you work it. You do the hard thing first. The thing that requires faith in your hands when your eyes cannot help you." He set the blank down. "This is not only a principle of optics."

Enzo waited. The maestro had a way of arriving at his point through territory that seemed unrelated, the way a canal sometimes runs away from the sea before turning back.

"I have a commission," Bardolino said. "Private. The client requires discretion."

"Private commissions are forbidden without guild—"

"I said the client requires discretion, Enzo." Bardolino's voice did not rise, but something in it closed, the way a furnace door closes — the light cut off all at once. "Do you understand the word, or do I need to choose a simpler one?"
