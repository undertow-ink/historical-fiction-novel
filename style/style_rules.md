# Style Rules

This document defines hard rules and guidelines that all prose in the novel must follow. It is loaded into the writer agent's system prompt (Layer 1) and enforced by the editor agent during every editing pass.

Rules marked **HARD** are never broken. Rules marked **SOFT** may be broken intentionally and sparingly for deliberate effect, but each violation should be justifiable.

## 1. Banned Words and Phrases

These words and phrases are common in AI-generated prose and generic fiction. Their presence is a signal that the writing is not specific enough. Find the precise, concrete, original alternative.

### HARD: Banned AI-Tell Words

Never use these words in narration. They may appear in dialogue only if they are part of a specific character's established speech pattern.

**Emotional abstractions used as shorthand:**
- "a sense of" / "a feeling of"
- "palpable" (as in "the tension was palpable")
- "tangible" (as in "a tangible sense of dread")
- "ineffable"
- "indescribable"
- "unspoken" (as in "an unspoken understanding")

**Overused descriptors:**
- "vibrant"
- "sprawling"
- "bustling"
- "quaint"
- "picturesque"
- "breathtaking"
- "stunning"
- "awe-inspiring"
- "majestic"
- "enigmatic"
- "piercing" (eyes)
- "chiseled" (jaw/features)
- "cascading" (hair)
- "lithe"
- "sinewy"

**AI-pattern phrases:**
- "couldn't help but"
- "found himself/herself [verb]ing"
- "let out a breath he/she didn't know they were holding"
- "a mix of [emotion] and [emotion]"
- "something shifted"
- "the weight of [abstraction]"
- "a flicker of [emotion] crossed his/her face"
- "the silence stretched between them"
- "eyes that held [emotion/quality]"
- "the world seemed to [verb]"
- "time seemed to slow/stop"
- "sent a shiver down his/her spine"
- "a small/sad/knowing smile"
- "a single tear rolled down"
- "heart pounding in his/her chest"
- "knuckles white"
- "jaw clenched/set"
- "let out a breath"
- "swallowed hard"
- "nodded slowly"
- "the ghost of a smile"
- "it was as if"
- "little did they know"
- "in that moment"
- "for what felt like an eternity"
- "with a newfound [quality]"
- "a testament to"
- "served as a reminder"
- "it spoke volumes"
- "the irony was not lost on"
- "against all odds"

**Filler transitions:**
- "meanwhile"
- "furthermore"
- "moreover"
- "indeed"
- "in fact"
- "it should be noted"
- "needless to say"

### SOFT: Avoid Unless Justified

These are not banned but should be used rarely and never as a crutch:

- "suddenly" (restructure the sentence to create suddenness through rhythm)
- "very" / "really" / "quite" / "rather" (find a stronger word)
- "began to" / "started to" (just do the action)
- "seemed to" / "appeared to" (commit to the observation or qualify it properly)
- "managed to" (just do the action)
- "almost" (either it happened or it did not -- unless the almost-ness is the point)

## 2. Structural Variety

### HARD: Sentence Openings

- No more than two consecutive sentences may begin with the same word.
- No more than three consecutive sentences may begin with a pronoun (he, she, they, I).
- No more than two consecutive sentences may begin with a participial phrase ("[Verb]ing...").
- The opening sentence of every chapter and every scene must not begin with a pronoun.

### HARD: Sentence Length

- Every page must contain at least one sentence of 5 words or fewer.
- Every page must contain at least one sentence of 25 words or more.
- No more than three consecutive sentences may be of similar length (within 5 words of each other).

### SOFT: Paragraph Length

- Vary paragraph length. A page of uniformly sized paragraphs feels monotonous.
- Use single-sentence paragraphs for emphasis, but no more than two per page.
- Dialogue-heavy passages naturally have shorter paragraphs. Balance with longer narrative paragraphs between exchanges.

---

## 3. Dialogue Rules

### HARD: Dialogue Tags

- "Said" and "asked" are the default tags. They are invisible to the reader. Use them.
- Never use: "exclaimed," "declared," "proclaimed," "opined," "queried," "retorted," "quipped," "interjected," "mused" (as a tag), "breathed" (as a tag).
- Permitted alternatives to "said" (use sparingly, max 2-3 per chapter): "whispered," "shouted," "called," "murmured," "replied."
- Prefer action beats over tags when the speaker is clear. An action beat does double duty: it attributes the line and reveals character.

### HARD: Dialogue Formatting

- Use quotation marks for spoken dialogue (double quotes in American English, single in British).
- Use em-dashes (---) for interrupted speech. The dash replaces the closing punctuation.
- Use ellipses (...) for speech that trails off. The character chooses to stop.
- Never use italics for internal thought. Integrate thought into the close narration naturally.
- Each new speaker gets a new paragraph.

### SOFT: Dialogue Quality

- Every line of dialogue should either advance the plot, reveal character, or create/resolve tension. Ideally two of three.
- Avoid on-the-nose dialogue where characters say exactly what they feel or mean. People hedge, deflect, lie, change the subject, and talk around the point.
- Avoid "maid and butler" dialogue where characters tell each other things they both know for the reader's benefit.
- Keep speeches short. If a character speaks for more than four sentences without interruption, there should be a strong dramatic reason.

## 4. Show, Don't Tell

### HARD: Emotion

- Never name an emotion in narration and leave it at that ("He was angry," "She felt sad"). The emotion must be demonstrated through:
  - Physical sensation ("His hands shook" instead of "He was nervous")
  - Action ("She swept the cups off the table" instead of "She was furious")
  - Dialogue (what the character says and how they say it)
  - Imagery (the environment reflecting or contrasting the mood)
  - Rhythm (short, clipped sentences for tension; long, flowing ones for calm)
- Exception: In deep POV, the character may name their own emotion if the naming itself is the point ("This, she realized, was grief. She had wondered what it would feel like.").

### SOFT: Exposition

- Prefer dramatizing information over explaining it.
- When exposition is necessary, embed it in action or dialogue. A character can notice, remember, or discuss information more naturally than the narrator can deliver it.
- If a block of exposition exceeds 150 words without a character acting, speaking, or perceiving something new, break it up.

## 5. Pacing Guidelines

### HARD: Scene Openings

- Every scene must begin in the middle of something: an action, a sensation, a line of dialogue, or a concrete image. Never open with abstract reflection or summary.
- The first sentence of the novel, each part, and each chapter carries extra weight. Make it count.

### SOFT: Scene Closings

- End scenes on a moment of change, decision, revelation, or unanswered question.
- Avoid "going to sleep" endings unless the act of sleeping (or failing to sleep) is itself meaningful.
- Avoid summary closings ("And so the day ended...").

### SOFT: Transitions

- Between scenes within a chapter, use a scene break (blank line with centered `***`).
- The first sentence after a scene break should immediately orient the reader: who, where, when. Accomplish this through concrete detail, not exposition.
- Between chapters, the first sentence must re-anchor the reader even more firmly. Assume the reader put the book down overnight.

### SOFT: Pacing by Content Type

| Content Type | Target Pace | Techniques |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Action / conflict | Fast | Short sentences, single-clause, fragments, minimal interiority, strong verbs, tight paragraphs |
| Dialogue | Medium-fast | Crisp exchanges, action beats for rhythm, minimal narration between lines |
| Investigation / discovery | Medium | Mix of action and thought, questions driving forward, details building |
| Emotional / reflective | Slow | Longer sentences, imagery, interiority, sensory detail, breathing room |
| World-building / setting | Slow-medium | Grounded in character perception, layered into action, not info-dumped |

## 6. Transition Techniques

### SOFT: Scene-Level Transitions

Preferred methods for moving between scenes:

- **Cut on action:** End the previous scene mid-action or mid-thought. Open the next scene in a completely different moment. The reader's mind fills the gap.
- **Sensory bridge:** End one scene with a sensory detail (a sound, a smell) and open the next with a related but different sensory detail.
- **Thematic echo:** End one scene on a thematic note and open the next on the same theme from a different angle.
- **Contrast cut:** End one scene at an emotional extreme and open the next at the opposite extreme.

Avoid:

- Time-stamp transitions ("Three hours later...") except when the precise passage of time matters.
- "Meanwhile" transitions.
- Summary transitions ("The next two weeks passed uneventfully").

## 7. Period-Appropriate Language

### HARD: Anachronisms

- No word, phrase, concept, or object may appear in the prose that did not exist in the story's time period.
- This applies to metaphors and similes as well. A medieval character cannot think in terms of "a ticking clock" if mechanical clocks do not yet exist in their world.
- Narration must also avoid anachronisms, even in close third person, unless the narrator is explicitly positioned as a modern voice (which is rare in literary historical fiction).

### SOFT: Period Flavor

- Use period-appropriate vocabulary where it does not confuse the modern reader. A few well-chosen archaic words per page add flavor; too many create a wall.
- Sentence structures can echo the period's literary conventions lightly. A novel set in the 18th century might use slightly more formal, balanced syntax. A novel set in the Viking Age might favor more direct, paratactic construction.
- Titles, forms of address, oaths, and exclamations should be period-accurate. Research these carefully. "God's blood" is Elizabethan; "Zounds" is earlier; "Damn" in its modern casual usage is surprisingly recent.
- Units of measurement, currency, and distance should use period terms where intelligible, with enough context for the modern reader to understand scale.

### HARD: Modern Sensibility

- Characters must think and act within the moral and intellectual framework of their time. Do not impose modern values on historical people.
- The narrator may provide context that allows the reader to see beyond the character's worldview, but characters themselves should not have anachronistic epiphanies about equality, rights, or ethics unless historically plausible.
- This does not mean endorsing historical injustice. It means depicting it honestly and trusting the reader.

## Quick Reference Card

Print this and keep it visible while writing:

```
BEFORE EVERY SENTENCE:
  - Is this the same opening word/structure as the last sentence?
  - Am I telling an emotion instead of showing it?
  - Is there a banned word or phrase?

BEFORE EVERY PARAGRAPH:
  - Does this paragraph do something the previous one did not?
  - Is the rhythm different from the surrounding paragraphs?

BEFORE EVERY SCENE:
  - Does it open in the middle of something?
  - Does every line of dialogue earn its place?
  - Does it end on a moment of change?

BEFORE EVERY CHAPTER:
  - Does the first sentence reorient the reader?
  - Is there variety in scene types (action, dialogue, reflection)?
  - Does the last line compel the reader to turn the page?
```
