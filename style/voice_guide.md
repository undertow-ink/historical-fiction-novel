# Voice Guide

This document defines the narrative voice for the novel. Every page of prose must conform to these rules. The writer agent loads this document into Layer 1 of every writing prompt.

**Instructions:** Fill in each section below before beginning the first draft. Replace the placeholder sample paragraphs with samples written in your novel's actual voice. Once finalized, this document should not change during the drafting process.

---

## Point of View

**POV type:**

> Choose one: first person, close third person, omniscient third person, second person, alternating (specify pattern).

**POV discipline:**

> How strict is the POV? In close third, can the narrator describe things the POV character would not notice? In first person, how reliable is the narrator? Define the boundaries.

**POV shifts:**

> If the novel uses multiple POV characters, define the rules. When can POV shift -- only at chapter breaks? At scene breaks? What signals the shift to the reader?

---

## Tense

**Primary tense:**

> Choose one: past tense, present tense.

**Exceptions:**

> Are there passages in a different tense? Flashbacks? Frame narratives? Dream sequences? Define when tense shifts are permitted and how they are signaled.

---

## Register

**Formality level:**

> Where does the prose sit on the spectrum from colloquial to literary? Describe in concrete terms: sentence complexity, vocabulary level, how much the prose draws attention to itself versus staying transparent.

**Narrative distance:**

> How close is the narrator to the character's thoughts? Deep interiority (we are inside their head, thinking their thoughts in their words) or more removed (the narrator describes the character's state from a slight distance)?

**Period calibration:**

> The prose should feel like it belongs in the story's time period without being incomprehensible to a modern reader. Define the balance. Which period speech patterns, vocabulary, or sentence structures will be used? Which modern conventions will be retained for readability?

---

## Sentence Rhythm

**Default rhythm:**

> Describe the typical cadence. Long, flowing sentences with subordinate clauses? Short and declarative? A deliberate mix? Provide a general description of the rhythm the reader should feel.

**Variation rules:**

> How does rhythm change with content? Define the shift for: action scenes, emotional peaks, quiet reflection, dialogue-heavy passages, description. For example: "Action uses sentence fragments and single-clause sentences. Reflection uses longer, periodic sentences with embedded clauses."

---

## Metaphor and Imagery Style

**Imagery source world:**

> Where do metaphors and similes come from? The character's world (a sailor thinks in terms of the sea, a farmer in terms of land and seasons) or the narrator's broader vocabulary? Define the domain of imagery.

**Density:**

> How frequently do metaphors appear? Every paragraph? Once per page? Only at key emotional moments? Overuse dilutes impact.

**Style:**

> Spare and precise, or lush and layered? Do images land in a single sharp phrase, or build through accumulation? Are they concrete and physical, or abstract and philosophical?

---

## Emotional Approach

**How emotions are conveyed:**

> Define the approach: through physical sensation, through action and behavior, through imagery, through the rhythm of the prose itself? Avoid naming emotions directly (see style_rules.md).

**Restraint level:**

> Where does the prose sit between stoic understatement and raw emotional intensity? Most literary historical fiction operates with more restraint than genre fiction. Define the range.

**The role of silence and absence:**

> What is left unsaid? What does the narrator deliberately not describe? Negative space can be as powerful as prose. Define how and when to use it.

---

## Dialogue Style

**Dialogue realism level:**

> Fully naturalistic (with stumbles, fragments, interruptions) or lightly stylized for readability? How much period flavor appears in dialogue versus narration?

**Dialect and accent:**

> How are regional or class differences in speech represented? Through vocabulary choice? Through syntax? Through phonetic spelling (use sparingly if at all)? Define the approach for each major character group.

**Dialogue mechanics:**

> Preferred tag style: primarily "said" and "asked" with action beats, or a wider range of tags? How are long exchanges formatted -- frequent tags, or reliance on the rhythm of alternation? How are interruptions marked (em-dash)?

## Sample Paragraphs

Replace these three samples with paragraphs written in your novel's actual voice. They serve as calibration references for the writer agent. Each sample should be 75-150 words.

### Sample 1: Tension Scene

> [REPLACE THIS with a sample paragraph depicting a moment of tension, danger, or conflict. Demonstrate how the voice handles elevated stakes: sentence rhythm, sensory focus, pacing. This should show your prose at its tightest and most urgent.]

*Example placeholder:* The corridor narrowed. Stone pressed close on both sides, slick with something he chose not to examine. Ahead, the torch guttered and nearly died. He stopped. Listened. Nothing -- and that was worse than footsteps, because footsteps could be counted and the silence could hold anything at all. He moved forward. One hand on the wall. One hand on the knife he had promised himself he would not need.

### Sample 2: Reflective Scene

> [REPLACE THIS with a sample paragraph depicting a quiet, introspective moment. Demonstrate how the voice handles interiority, memory, and contemplation. This should show your prose at its most expansive and meditative.]

*Example placeholder:* She sat at the window long after the candle burned down, watching the harbor empty of light. There had been a time -- she could almost place the year, the season, the particular quality of the air -- when the sight of ships at anchor had meant possibility. Now they were only wood and rope and the labor of men she would never meet, going to places she would never see. She was not bitter. Bitterness required energy she had spent elsewhere. She was simply still, the way a pond is still after you stop throwing stones into it.

### Sample 3: Dialogue Scene

> [REPLACE THIS with a sample passage of dialogue between two characters. Demonstrate how the voice handles conversation: tag style, action beats, subtext, rhythm of exchange. This should show how your characters sound when they speak.]

*Example placeholder:*

"You cannot mean to go." Margaret set down her cup with the particular care she reserved for moments when she wished to throw it. "Not now. Not with everything as it is."

"Everything is always as it is. That is the nature of everything."

"Do not be clever with me. I have known you too long for clever."

He looked at her across the table and saw the woman she had been at twenty, fierce and certain, overlaid on the woman she was now, still fierce but certain of nothing except that the world was determined to take things from her. He owed her honesty. He gave her something close to it.

"I will be back before the frost."
